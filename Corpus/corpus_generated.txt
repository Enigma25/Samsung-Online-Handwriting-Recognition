The possible toxicological
effects of substances added
to food during growth
transport and processing 7
Presentation Each of these
is a vast field of research
and investigation The
overall pattern
The research structure has of
course developed piecemeal and
the type and scope of the work
of any individual institute is
rarely exclusive Nevertheless some
might argue that since the purpose
of food is to keep man fit and
healthy the greatest emphasis should
be on its nutritional quality
The total annual cost of all
this research by the Council now
exceeds 5 million To quote from
its last annual reports This is
equally tlrue whether the production
is on our own farms or those overseas
For 1960 the incomes were
LIST Of this total 207 840
was provided by industry and
the remainder by DSIR
It must be remembered
however that a research
association by its nature and
organisation should be an
extremely objective efficient
and economic research unit
The primary interest of
each of these associations
is to improve and standardize
the manufacturing or processing
methods and the quality of the
final products of the particular
industry it serves In contrast with
most of the research units
associated with the agricultural
research Council the emphasis is
on the factors outside the farm gate
Although a search association serves
a whole industry it is significant that
 often the work of the association
has encouraged individual firms to start
up or extend their own laboratories In this
way the research associations have
brought a much greater scientifig
outlook and interest
So do I I dont want them
to have to swim Will you show
the chief the orders I have a
tongue He stalked off I was
in bad odour with him
The souslieutenant had an eye for
positioning Suddenly one realised exactly
what was meant by covering fire I
dragged him back Are you mad These are
disciplined soldiers
These forests of the Congo

He has forced my hand
It is utterly unforgivable
It s easy for you to talk
How does he do it Why
didnt you watch I did He
drew a lighted cigar from out
of my cassock How embarrassed
I was It would have been interesting
to see him try it on Agnes
In command of them was a cold
souslieutenant a veteran of the Indo
Chinese war I think he rather hoped
for a small brisk action He paraded
his troops at the fringe of the village
He came hurrying out He cried
But I never dreamt you were
serious It was the nearest thing
to rage I d ever seen in him
Agnes came palely behind
It matters to me The
Governor would assassinate
me I stared beseechingly
at Agnes She said to
Father Felix Be still
We re to move the tribe
out of the valley
with the minimum of
force 
That one I have seen A
few mock pistolshots into it
A sabre slammed fearsomely through
it in all directions The natives
suddenly expectant of tragedy  but
the crate opened and the young imp
of mischief came waddlin out
Agnes can we forget the
personal aspect for a moment
What did he do He produced
a white chicken from his
props He held it up It
fluttered and squawked
PIt might have gone down well up
near Lake Chad where there is an
Arabic influence  on these denser
sons of Ham it had no effect at all
He went swiftly on to cigarette triks
Joe Moses opened up a large coloured
box to show that  it was empty He
called out what shall we have for
supper Sucking pig and persuaded one
of the women to throw a cheap
bangle into the box
It wasnt enough He had
to embarrass me further  he
picked up an egg as if it had
been freshly laid   I ve
seen that trick performed in
the Bobino in Paris  
Still it must have been a
wonderful show  He made a
wonderful fool of himself Agnes
said It was fate in fact that
was making fools of all of us

have qualified it He has to have
brains in his head too Remember

It might therefore be said that his lapse
in regarding fossils as sports of nature
is here offset by his penetration as to
their possible use I think Lister had
in mind merely the characterizing of
different types of rocks by
distinctive fossils

We turn to his natural history
of Wiltshire confidently expecting some

geological environment is the primary
factor in determining the character of a
country not only topographically
but historically
For instance their record of fossils
at either a particular height above
sealevel or depth below the
surface in mines and quarries
shows their ignorance of the
subject of stratification
Except in the rare horizontally
bedded rocks these data have no
significance chronologically
The primary division of strata
in the hierarchy of their classification
is according to age not lithology To
elevate the latter is to produce a
barren classification This study
together with his scholarly researches
into the Welsh and other 
Gaelic languages formed his lifes
work
It is very interesting to see the

Molyneuxs Suggestion that

Nineteen years before Hookes
discourse the implication of
stratification had been announced
to an indifferent scientific World
by Steno As founder of the
science of crystallography
Steno would hardly confuse

The colonial Secretary Mr Lennox
Boyd allowed the storm to beat
around him The situation remained
unchanged Dr Banda and his
colleagues remained in prison A
considerable section of British opinion
aware at last of the great potentialities
for danger in Central Africa began to
view the whole Federation with deep
uneasiness
The independence disasters in
the Congo had their immediate
and obvious repercussions in the
Rhodesias In spite of its popular
name it associates more naturally
with animals such as the fox and
the badger which live in large
burrows
The new approach
was cautious but
apparent The result
was a temperate but
unmistakable reorien
tation of the British
attitude towards the
dependencies in Africa
Hastings Banda had
something messianic for the
people of Nyasaland Seven months
after Dr Bandas return the first
trouble came Fifteen Africans were
arrested in February 1959 for holding
an unauthorized meeting in the
northern province of Nyasaland
While the State of emergency was
justified it added there was no
evidence of anything that could
be called a plot Dr Banda
said the Commission would not
have approved any such policy
of murder
All around the political stormclouds
grew Precisely the contrary came to pass
With virtually no practical means of political
selfexpression national i movements grew
inwards upon themselves In each of the
territories the usual African National congress
existed
Dr Banda had been a doctor
in North London most of the time
combining the practice of medicine
with political campaigning for
African causes For the three years
before his return he had been in
Ghana
I used to play about in these things
when I was a kid And then I acted
as guide on a river boat one summer
to keep myself going between
terms at college
No thank you Clive I shall be
able to manage Afterwards he
drove me back to Bletcham and we
parted like old friends He suggested
another meeting but I refused the
boat was such an attraction that
I was afraid if he came near it
again that I should never see the last of
him
When the pouring ritual was over he 
went on  There won  t be any happiness 
for me until I can prove him guilty   You 
 re already certain that he did it 
aren  t you  
As long as my suspect
suspicion remained in my head
I could pretend to myself in
moments of optimism that it was
not true It could have been anyone
I said lamely
I m going to buy a boat
and moor it near Hardys
house I rushed on
I m going to find out
everything I can about him 
 Why 
Tell me about it while
we eat
He chose a Greek restaurant
in Soho to get me used to
the food he said
It was a quiet place and I
was glad I needed to be able
to talk
We climbed aboard and he eased 
his wiry frame through the cabin 
door and wandered about inside 
opening everything that would open 
Like Clive he was enthusiastic 
about the engine and decided apparently 
on the strength of its efficiency that 
Sandpiper was fit to live in 
There s a place just below
Bletcham near the foot
bridge   I know it 
He looked doubtful There are
better places  he commented
I know but that s where I m
going
No I said outside your Office
I could not endure the thought of
another wait at the bus station He
was there punctually He settled me
into the car with touching care and
then drove like a friend along the
river road
You can see it any time you like
he told me The sooner the better If
you can get to Bletcham this evening
I ll run you up there in the car
 Cold water suits you Don  t complain  
 I wasn  t going to  I said  I shan  t be 
here much longer   I know You  re coming 
to Greece with me  
I can  t wait for ever you know 
 I know Just give me a little 
time Max say three months If 
I haven  t discovered anything by 
that time I  ll give up 
trying  
That makes two of us From this
side Rivermead was less forbidding it
stood a long way back from the water
at the end of a velvety lawn flanked
with flowering trees and shrubs
 That  s her  he said 
 Sandpiper   he was not an eye 
catching craft It was a long time 
before  I got used to calling 
them portholes At last he 
pronounced me riverworthy and 
wanted to know when I would be moving
in 
I was touched and flattered
by his manner which was most
attractive in its friendliness This
young man was ignoring the
defences and I liked him for it It
did not occur to me until
a long time afterwards that he
was perhaps a shade too friendly
No he said at last I cant
allow it You cant very well
stop me I can do better than
that If we were to get
married now I could come
with you
I pictured her trawl
trundling over the bottom and
I thought of the herring we
could not find though knowing
they were present Praying
mantis By B G Furner A trial
in Kent as a form of
biological pest control
Bottom crowding comes when
they cannot reach their
optimum depth and this
coincides with the suitable
gravelly soil of these many
roughs where the springspaw
ning herring are always found
The joint evidence of echosoun
ders and fishing gear leads to
an overall though somewhat dim
picture
A good picture of this is 
seen on the 150 miles of 
spawning grounds from the 
Viking in the North down it to 
the Klondykes and the Reef 
along the Western edge of 
Norwegian deep 
This might be explained by a 
change in behaviour of the fish 
or even indirectly of the feed ani 
mals on the bottom The point is 
however that once round fish are persua 
ded into the path of the seine net they 
would probably be less disturbed than they 
would be by the fastermoving trawl 
The East Anglian behaviour 
see p 82 has always differed 
from that of the summer 
fisheries There is the  swim  
at slack waters even in 
daylight sometimes and the 
high swimming when fish are 
caught only in the top few yards 
of netting 
Let us consider first what
would appear to be the
simplest case  that of flat
fish on the bottom The evidence
suggest that the fish are aware
of the moving footrope before
it reaches them
Recent research on
the swimming speeds
of fish shows that they
soon get tired hence the suc
cess of the trawl The lifting
reaction is interesting since it
seem in a way to be the last
resource
If the herring react to the
disturbance ahead of the trawl
like other fish then increased
speed alone is not the answer
You cannot catch a bow wave
Herring trawling One calm summer
day in 1937 we lay waiting to
shoot our drift nets
Some will spawn at the
Hinder banks which are
halfway and it may be that
in their southery march the
herring will spawn wherever the
suitable gravelly bottom soil
coincides with their final
ripeness
This suggests that cover might
be more important than speed
Yet we should realise that
a smack with a strong wind
and tide could move a trawl
fast over the ground The more
we think about trawling and
seineing the more we realise how
different they are
In the case of herring trawling
great emphasis is placed on the
needs for fast towing The Germans
who are the recognised experts at this have
been using bigger and bigger ships towing at
over 4 knots
Given the same initial
data any person using the
method will produce the
same forecast Most
objective techniques depend
on the production of either
formulae diagrams and
both methods have been
subject to various weakness
The system which was devised
consists of a composite diagram
such as that illustrated at Fig 1
The pecked line on the diagram
indicates its method of use The
top lefthand section is entered
with the appropriate value of the
first predictor and successive
turns are made at the appropriate
isopleths of each of the other
predictors the forecast being
read from the scale exit
The weak trough over
Norway was quite adequately
forecast in middle latitudes
but was moved too rapidly in the
South This rapid movement in the
South was almost certainly associated
with the strong gradients
produced by the spurious
anticyclogenesis
To assist in selecting the
more promising predictors each
parameter x was correlated in
turn with the visibility to
be forecast z The correlation
coefficient r was calculated
from the formula FORM where
SD was the standard deviation
of the visibility to be forecast
Each section of the
diagram combines a new
predictor with an estimate
of the predictand obtained
from the previous sections
At each stage the predictor
to be selected is that
which contributes most
to the combination far
chosen
B Examples of forecasts
These two situations were chosen
because the former forecast produced
a large rms error at 500 and
200 mb and was not one of the better
forecasts whereas the latter was
typical of one of the good forecasts
Most of the parameters tested are listed in
table 2 The geostrophic winds over London
Airport were measured from surface charts at the
Central forecasting Office Dunstable The wind
shear was defined as the ration of the surface
wind speed to the geostrophic wind speed
The vertical motion patterns
in Fig 8 are consistent with
the synoptic features forecast
in figs 5 to 7 7 Conclusions

William Connor Who began

secret ambition was to
write a similar column but
with a rightwing slant
She was right He was wrong
My best line was whether it
were better to ride to hunt or
hunt to ride I was for the
former on account of the fact
that I was never a brilliant
horseman
But none of them convinced me Yet it was 
still bad enough The army was now my life I had 
even been accused of outsoldiering the soldiers I 
 had enjoyed every minute from wet

Skilful picture The BBCs

short sections confirms that
Mr Bennett is one of the most
musical of our younger
composers He does not in this journal
write one note too many
Stared back did Price the
provisions unwinking Mr Price
I think you may be able to help
us here said the Rev Edwards
Price shook his head
Paled did Dai For the
twotwenty carried for him
a cargo more precious than
jewels Though Mofydd
Owen was as he feared
departed out of his life he
still loved her dearly
A nice boy of course
But perhaps in the new
World she was entering
there might be boys
equally nice and with
far more to offer
The conductor rang
his bell
So the driver peeppeeped as though
he were edging his way through a herd of
cows instead of hurting through empty
space Thank you the Rev Edwards said
courteously
His spirits were rising
He had seen no sign of
an accident Therefore Mr
Roberts must have been mistaken He
would find the bus safe and sound
in Llangrwl and his dear Morfydd
quietly having tea in her own home
A combination of the two
No one seems to know But
the fact remains that get
itself into orbit it did And a
fine old fuss there was
about it too
What have you got in that
basket Price he roared
Quelled Mr Price pulled out a
grocery list pushed his glasses
up on his nose and began to
read
That was their attitude
But losing a bus People were
always losing things You d be
surprised they said So it seemed
for a time that the whole affair
would be written off as one of
those unexplained mysteries like
the Marie Celeste
But Eth and me wanted
to be at the youth hostel
before dark Morfydd Owen
was silent But she looked
down at the fastdisappearing
earth and it seemed to her
that she would never see her
Dai again
God bless my immortal soul he
cried Never mind your immortal
soul said Megan Thomas tatoo
Here we are traversing the heav
ns at the very moment when
we should be running into
Llangrwl bus station
I see So you met a bus at
fifty thousand feet All lit up Full of
people waving as you went past
Suddenly he crouched forward Broughtons
If I thought there were anything in Queens
regulations to cover this I d have you
courtmartialled
Fingered his ticketpunch
nervously Peered out of the
window Went and consulted
the driver Damned if I know
boy said the driver But
something very untoward has
happened if you ask me
The conductor switched
on the lights The beleaguered
passengers peered out of the
windows Little to be seen only
a few lone stars and the
distant earth brooding in
her shroud of mist
And so did the arms of Dai Pugh How
could they be otherwise when his
beloved was circling the poles at three
andaquarterhour intervals regular as
clockwork Time passed Local bus disappears
announced the Dinas advertiser
Very interested I was
For there was his garage hand Dai
Pugh taking a thoght tearful farewell
of Mylord Owen But I m only going
fifteen miles away Morfydd was saying
They d got the lights on
There were people inside
Waving Like gimlets the
station Commanders eyes
Did you see the indicator
Board Yes sir
Shaken Ifor Evans was
And what are you going to
do about it Tendentious Mr
Roberts sounded What do you
want me to do Send out a sheriffs
posse is it
Now what does such a
person do He signals his
position by ligthing bonfires
or hoisting a flag on a palm
tree And he tries to ensure
a supply of food 
Twothirtyfive on the dot
It s supposed to leave at
twotwenty Who says so
Your timetable Start running
punctual and where are you
Well actually sir it looked like  like a bus
A singledecker he elaborated Daggers the
group Captain looked Broughtons He said
silkily
They looked at him sullen His heart
sank If the Welsh found the situation too
desperate for singing then the situation
he realised must be desperate indeed But
suddenly they were roused from their
lethargy
The show must go on
He had lines to speak Mr
Smith gave him his cue
Now then Herman Mr
Hermans Faintly masklike
smile was almost pathetic
Mr Copthorne turned grey Without
any waiting panicstricken and
regardless of the rest he made a
scuttling exit through the cloakroom
door leading out on to the side
entrance Mr Herman took over with
one word
The church clock was striking seven He
had slipped on to the stone floor The door was
open The verger had just unlocked it and was
about to depart when he saw Mr Copthorne
entering in his very strange purple and scarlet
robes getup
He was not on the seat He
was cowering on the floor
Stop No Put me down at
the church  Very good The
chauffeur did not sir his
employer
Perhaps Perhaps But  but you are not
going to leave me Count You know how
I rely on your Services The chauffeur
did not deign to answer
Mr Copthorne knew a
way round by the side of
the church where there was
a small open outbuilding
where the grave digger
kept his spades and
forks and tidying up
implements It might be open
Mr Copthorne was on
dry land in a church
outbuilding but this was
happening to him now
He saw himself as a
sulky ugly malformed
repressed boy then a young
youth
Turn your noses to the kitchen  Is that
your trick snapped Mr Smith Trying
to smoke us out eh Been burning something
You ll have to think of something better than
that
At another table nearby Mr
Smith and two of his officers
in plain clothes were quietly
chatting together Saturnalia was
about tho proceed within that
profane cellar The air was heavy
and thick with the combined smells
Mr Herman raised his voice above the and
roar of smoke and flames Infinite pathos regret and
sadness was in it How weary stale flat and
unprofitable seem all the uses of this World
The fire brigade has arrived
Hear it Regis Road Pavements will
soon be crowded with latehomers
gathering to witness a fire in full
bloom Standing room only for nothing
to pay
I have had enough to last me
Tail it off Herman Where s
Copthorne My leader in this fiendish
racket my dear sir is not in the
house
He died for all And Christianity
goes on Mr Copthornes Breathing
was deep and laboured He seemed
to be sighing I d like to go up
to the belfry
The verger led the way in The
stained glass windows sir they date
back to the fourteenth century Mr
Copthorne looked and saw the light
stealing through upon the illuminated
figures of Saints and a Central figure
upon a cross
I am sure and certain it was
the cat  let go of me George
 Dont be a fool Con I ll bee

David was continuing to play
it up well Dont you know I
am a very wealthy woman
Heavens Carrie I had no
idea you were a wealthy
woman
At the bar David ordered a bottle 
of champagne and three glasses to 
be sent over to his table He 
thought that perhaps a glass or 
two of champagne might get Miss 
Dodd into a friendly mood 
Doesnt your sister ever come
here to dance Often when
she is at home At N the mo

you are all alone for the time
Vera said Champagne This
is certainly a celebration Vera
Immediately excused herself to
go off and dance with a man she
knew David said Shall we dance
A waltz is one of the dances
which enables you to get close
to the woman The moment he
found she danced as well as
he did he drew her closer to
him she gave willingly
He beckoned over a waiter

never been made love to by such an experienced 
man as David Carson he literally swept her 
off her feet 
How wonderful it would 
be to marry a quarter of a 
million pounds Feeling it 
would not be wise to rush 
matters so soon he finished his 
drink and suggested they returned 
to the dance room 
David Who sensed the various opinions
and felt some pressure might eventually
be brought to bear on Caroline to
think again pleaded for an early
marriage She was not adverse to the
suggestion but he had to use a deal of
pressure before she would agree to a quick
marriage at a registry in Starminster
She is the sort over
who would make a good
wife for a man  You dont
think the sister would is that it 
 No that is not it
Vera looked at Caroline David
found them a small table pulled
up three chairs waited until the
two were seated then he said
I think this calls for a celebration
I should never be bored
in such charming company
as yours In spite of herself
Caroline felt herself flush
You must come and take a
look round the grounds of the

the great advantages
Or should one call them heart children 
All their hearts are in the right place and 
they run true and sweet to family form No 
one is cantankerous there are no petty 
jealousies or mutual animosities 
Miss Jennifer Stirling plays
Miss Edie with great skill
and charm and Mr Willard Stoker
effectively coordinates a
good cast Rare acting in
Betti play A quietly
effective production
Oxford Playhouse Irene
Against this industrial
setting Mr Richardson
has told Miss Delaneys story
Its faults are still apparent
But there is heart in the telling
and an intense realism in
the situation
It is always difficult when
assessing a moving and
eloquent performance
by a young and immature
actress to judge the extent
to which her acting has
been inspired by skilled
and sensitive direction
Here it is combined with another
theme dear to his heart the
workings of justice A nice simple
sergeant of the Carabinieri arrives
in a strange village at night to
investigate some irregularities
concerning the town clerk
Film virtues in a taste of honey

Foodlore reflects much more of
National temperament than is
customarily imagined as well as
entering human activities to a greater
extent than is usually assumed The
Czechoslovak kitchen again is so
languerous so passionate and possibly
comparable alone to a gypsy melody
And if certain dishes and modes
of food have persisted down the
ages the motive that preserved them
has always been the same Apart from
the need for nourishment

He turned it over on the

formality of having his

Foodlore reflects much

leg of mutton with oyster and veal stuffing
and a gin punch The young woma

A fascinating study also opens up in the
dietary welcomed by men of genius as well
as the foods for which they have had an
aversion  Shelley  for example  had a
great contempt for animal food  believing
that it  impaired the intellectual
faculties  Bunyans
Among the natives of

roasted on the point of a spear
are definitely a delicacy
while Mediterranean peoples
have a high opinion of the
octopus as an article of diet 
So have the Japanese and the
Chinese  The
Taste and temperament in

one mans meat is another mans poison

truth Mankind has tried all kinds of
food from roots to birds nests and from
snails to elephants feet or walrus

Having exhausted their invention in the
preparation of stimulants for the palate they broke
fresh ground and called another sense to their aid By
delicate application of odours and richlydistilled
perfumes these refined voluptuaries aroused the fainting
appetite and added a more exquisite and ethereal

She came home early from the party
and found me at the job
But when he started up the
Grande Corniche I lost him
temporarly I was too intent on
catching up with him to be
aware that another car was following
me I had him in sight until he
disappeared down the side road
I happened to have the
lighter in my pocket I borrowed
it ages ago when my own lighter
ran out of fuel I had to
protect myself and Ray was
the obvious suspect
Her legs collapsed under her
She fell sprawling at his feet
And then suddenly it happened
A shot rang out He lurched and
gave a cry and dropped
beside her
Keep going Grant said in a
low harsh voice Dont kid yourself
I ll be timid about using this
revolver it s my life or yours
She couldnt scream because of
the gag in her mouth and he
held both her hands tightly behind her
back
You ll be unconscious by the time
you go over He took a flask
from his posket and got a
glass out of the glove
compartment of the car
She set her lips firmly
But what had finally prompted
him to abduct her in this way
with the obvious purpose of killing
her Depend he know that
she had Gretas clip But if he had
been Sarah was equally in danger
No she shrieked and pushed the
glass away from her He hit her
hard across the face but in her
present State of nervous tension
she scarcely felt it
Carol shuddered remembering the dream
Sarah had had What are you going to do with
me You re going over the edge he said
This is the highest point on the Grande
Corniche
She saw that it was
a beautiful Mediterranean
night with a full moon a
blue black sky and the
stars were shining brightly
But it was impossible to
feel amused for the cord
with which he had bound
her cut into her wrists and
ankles the gag  hurt her
mouth
I d Rather risk it she said
You ll have to shoot me before
I ll jump And when my body is
found the bullet will be traced
back to your gun
She must have passed out for the next
thing she knew he was shaking
her My darling She says something
to me I m All right Ray
she murmured
She had already aroused
Grants suspicions by her
questions She went quietly down
the staircase There was only
a short distance through the
foyer before she reached the
front door But when she tried
to close it after her a foot
was forced in the open doorway
Ray And Sarah were
also accustomed to it Even
if they were still awake
they would suspect nothing
It seemed reasonable to
suppose he had murdered
her beach because she had
come upon him in the act
of stealing her jewellery
You re not a fool I
know you ve put two and two
together ever since the child told you
about the clip But you suspected
me before that didnt you

The Secretary of State was

of a tribunal  to withdraw
a doctors authority to possess and
supply dangerous drugs and to
direct that such doctor  or
a doctor convicted of an
offence under the Act   should
not issue prescil prescriptions
for dangerous drugs  3 It was
made clear

in some circumstances
dangerous drugs were being
supplied in contravention of
the intention of Parliament
that a doctor should be
authorised to supply drugs

it an average in certain 
instances Appendix 1 gives

at a later stage we
arranged for publications

Through the system of records and
inspection then in operation cases were
brought to the notice of the Home Office

it became clear to us that carbromal

a number of drugs on sale to the
public which were not appropriate

Drugs Act  1951 
The changed situation 
16 In the thirtyfour years since 
the Rolleston Committee reported 
there have been developments 
in two directions which are of 
interest to our own Committee 
Some of these b have been derived 
from opium and others have been 
produced synthetically 
17 The second development
has been in the methods of
treatment of drug addiction
18 19 We have considered this
development Definitions adopted

 necessary to have a clear
and consistent idea of the phenomena
confronting us

To cheer my body
with wine Lit To draw
my flesh with wine
The phrase is difficult
This is a favourite word with
Qoheleth cf 221 322 518 ff 96
9 112 It carries the idea of reward
or profit Qoheleth is suggesting that
there is a gain from human
experience
The word for toil is
also used of sorrow and
vexation This is the problem
of communication in the
modern industrial World 3
Under the sun It means
simply alive
The act means more than the
recalling of past events The very
personality of a man continues into
the present through his being
remembered There is an element
of present reality in remembering
 the past is represented
The verb is parallel to test and
must be taken in this sense of
trying and experimenting The typical
Hebrew view of life is not a denial
of pleasure but the reverse We
need to remember the particular
quest that Qoheleth had in
mind

slaves The acquisition of slaves

sition of the scale of his

to the vital question of
water supply The pools are
posibly natural
The thought fits Qoheleths position
precisely The finishing line is
continually found to be but the
prelude to the starting post  the
sun gets nowhere 6 The wind blows 
the wind returns
This is a favourite phrase
of the writer and it is used
some seven times in this book
The literal meaning is a
feeding on the wind The
word is used of shepherds
feeding their flocks
The references is to the
underworld which was thought
to be the source both of fresh
water springs and of the salt
water oceans 9 The eye is
not satisfied  nor the ear

madness means mad revelry
and wickedness The quest for

12 I The preacher have
been king over Israel in Jerusalem
The author clearly intends to be
taken as Solomon The use of this
literary device was really a means of
expressing Qoheleths conviction that
neither wealth nor wisdom provided
the clue to the final meaning of life
All human activity as far as
its final significance is concerned
is like feeding on the wind or desiring
the shadowy insubstantial air 15 What
is crooked The root meaning of crooked
is to twist or pervert

I Personally spoke with my
heart All who were over Jerusalem
before me Wisdom and knowledge
These two terms are frequently
found in close association
Search out in wisdom
The original for search out
is used as a technical
term for consulting the
priest or the prophet

Shopping on two levels
has been introduced in a
number of towns and has
added to the interest of the
town centre As in the case
of factories and industrial sites
the corporations policy has been
to charge full commercial rents
for their shops and shopping
sites
Service industry In the
early stages of a new town
most of the working population
are employed in manufac
turing or basic industry These
Services develop at their own
pace in response to local de
mand however and little can be
done to stimulate them
All types of trader have
been encouraged  from the
large departmental store to the
small shoemender  with
banks specially sited on
corners or in separate courts
to avoid breaking into
the shopping frontage 
Shops Some development
corporations have sought to
attract private investors by
leasing part of the shopping
area to companies experienced
in commercial development
who have undertaken the
building and letting of
the shops
During this period when
large numbers of school

people in industry and

suppose that this pattern
is peculiar to Crawley

These figures are much higher than the
national averages  and may be thought to
indicate a lack of balance in some of
the towns  On the other hand these groups
offer fairly varied opportunities of skilled
employment and are highly diversified

rely mainly on the town

Whole families made their
livelihood by lacemaking and
consequently a folklore of song festival
and courtship grew up around the lace
industry Those who are interested
in this history will enjoy reading
about the charming coquetteries

Lace became the servant of
vanity and lent its rich decoration to
robes and dresses and one thinks
particularly of the extravagant Eliza
bethan ruffs and Carolean collars
Under Cromwell lace was dismissed as
ungodly  at least for the middle
and lower classes

There it was developed into
quite an elaborate and distinctive
form with rosettes leaves and

Victoria this gentle craft was
greatly abused It was some years
after the Victorian period that
designers realised the potentialities
of the craft and crochet was
revived with designs suitable for
contemporary trends
During the sixteenth
century a considerable
amount of crochet was produced
in th convents of Europe

It has long been understood
that the attractive forces
between nucleons the neutrons
and protons which comprise
nuclei were somehow concerned
with the interchange of a
particle the pmeson or pion
between them
A trivial defect in an abeam tube which
was cured empirically by inserting brass washers
to confine the beam suggested that aparticles
were reflected by metals He directed a beam of
aparticles at metal foils and observed the range
of angles at which they came off
The conference sessions however
consisted of the presentation of
invited papers each intended to
summarize a different aspect
of the subject Thirty years
ago Rhutherford said It is
my personal conviction that if
we knew more about the
nucleus we should find it
much simpler than we suppose
With these larger numbers of
extra nucleons it is no longer
practicable to treat them singly
and only their collective behaviour
is considered The way nucleons are
arranged in a nucleus and especially
in the surface regions of heavy nuclei
is another topic of current interest
She strengthened her will by
saying It is the way Then

The Captive with the boneless arms
added Some may be born wrong as
we are Some may be born right
Because we know all things the
Chief Captive said
For Lilyyo Flor and Haris there
were many events Chief of these
was that they learned to fly properly
The pains associated with their wings
soon died away as they wonderful
new flesh and tendon strengthened
All who make the journey
from the heavy World become
changed Some die Most live
and grow wings When you

Bondi himself had been carried
to the true World as
a boy
One had no legs One had
no flash on his lower jaw One
had four gnarled dwarf arms
One had short wings of flesh
connecting ear lobes and thumbs
so that he lived perpetually with
hands half raised to his face
This tribe of the true World
is good and knows these things
So it lets us rule it Flor And
Lilyyo muttered together
We do  Then why are you
captives 
So we ask you to go back
there on a great plan we have  Yes
We plan to attack the heavy World
You must help to lead our force
You are still young said the Chief Captive
You begin newly here Where are your souls
Lilyyo And Flor looked at each other In
their flight from the wiltmilt they had
heedlessly thrown down their souls
Its vast bulk held little sensation
The twelve humans glided down and
landed on its back low down on the
abdomen in a position hidden from
the creatures cluster of eyes They
sank among the tough shoulderhigh
fibres that served the traverser as hair
and looked about them

They had taken Bain to bring
her to the true world in burnurns  and
had not been heard of since Many perils
and mischances lay in that long double
journey Of those who set out few returned
Except from the tigerflies
Floor agreed They rested on a bare
peak where the air was thin and
even the giant creepers had not
climbed The turbulent green
stretched away below them almos
 as if they were on earth 
although here it was
continually checked by the
circular formations of rock
Soon we must fight
Then we can come back
here again They would
miss the trees  We shall
soon miss the trees no longer
We have wings instead 
For gradually the humans
adapted better to the true World
And all this as on the heavy
World conditions grew more and
more adverse to anything but the
giant vegetables Lilyyo At least
was quick to see how much
easier life was in these new
conditions

your life free from harm No the Chief Captive

Professors notion that he d
been trailed He turned the
key softly in the lock for
the first time since he d
slept in this house
The other two servants
had gone out a while since
Johnson was in the laboratory
with sufficient work to occupy
him for an our at least He d
been very late the previous
night and was trying desperately
to make up the time he d lost
Where was it He was
certain  beyond a
shadow of doubt that he
placed it there this morning
His gaze flashed around There
was a tape on the recorder
which he d left bare last night
He relived the scene in the
laboratory then he drifted
into sleep What was that
Frank sat up and listened
He heard a sharp clickclick
He switched on the table lamp
swung his feet the floor and
reached for his robe
When he d tied the belt of his
bathrobe he slipped the tape into the
pocket He ran his fingers through his
hair while he figured I Only need
the right opportunity to snatch the
packet then carry it to New York and my
part is over
Autumn The loveliest season
of the year A figure was
crossing the stone courtyard
below Benn returning from
his errand no doubt Frank
turned away Then a new line of
thought arrested him
Then going over to the door he
released it The passage was empty
Is someone there he queried No one
replied No sound disturbed the heavy
silence which now ruled the house
I have fastened the door and am now
seated before the recorder Frank I have
invented a weapon which I call liquid
glass Liquid glass is in the form
of small crystals
The trees were scarcely
discernible a serene autumnal
scene He wandered back into his
bedroom Here he shook out
a Stuyvesant from the packet
on the small table and used
his lighter
Within the right hand pocket
reposed the tape How could he
have been so careless as to
leave it here But it was all
right he reflected the next
instant The dwelling was deserted
Frank crossed to the second door
and turned the handle There were
several pieces of furniture  stored in
here Resting against the opposite wall
were a row of pictures gilded frames
turned towards the wall
He was aware that the
task must be delicately
done He owed that to Zinner
man At length it was fi
nished and the square
piece of plywood fell away
There resting against the
canvas was a small sealed
packet measuring not more
than six inches by four
Lifting off the tape he
hesitated over what he should
do with it He could of
course remove the message but
he naturally preferred to carry
it with the sealed packet to
Slade
He thought wretchedly How
much harm have I Caused
already How could he tee
There just wasnt time to
waste in selfreproach for this
criminal carelessness on his Part
He moved over to the window
and looked down upon the
garden
How about the telly tomorrow
afternoon He felt a glow of
happiness steal over him She
wasnt going to break with
him after all For the moment
it was the only thing in the
World that mattered
The parrot nose and straight line of the
mouth the pitiless blue eyes that seemed
to strip him right down to his abjectly quaking
bones The mouldering horror that had once been
Henry Mansell taunted him now in the silent
darkness
Same with the passport It s
gone and that s that It may
turn up in a dustbin somewhere
or at the back of a drawer
As far as the police are
concerned there s nothing to
go on
Hugh nodded I realized
that after my talk with
Mrs Lawford There are a
dozen countries where a
man could easily hide up
and change the money
without danger Unless
we can get a definite
line on him it s hopeless 
I was sorry to read about your
dad in the paper the man said to
Hugh in a thick voice which bore
traces of a cockney accent I was
telling your friend how he come in here
the very night he passed away
OK Bob But watch your
step He s a tough customer
mark my words Harry said in
a low voice Bone Half smiled
in the darkness
I spoke to a chap from the Office of the
Director of public prosecutions I know
pretty well and he agreed that the missing
cash is a hell of a mystery But as he
quite reasonably pointed out the money could
have been disposed of in London before your
father left that evening
If we could get rid of him 
Harry nodded his grizzled head
like an old hound You re right there
Bob he muttered But it s easier said
than done
You know whoever it was might
have known of the existence
of the suicide letter 
providing him with an almost
unshakable alibi Hugh was thinking
of his uncle but said nothing
Tonight for the first time
he had abandoned all pretence
and shown her the honest des
peration of his feeling for her
She had neither encouraged nor
completely rejeted him In some
perverse way their brief quarrel
had forged a bond between them
So long Bod she said waving
her hand to him Nice night
he remarked affably Do they
Bone glanced up at the sky
his thoughts elsewhere
He could hardly believe it and blinked several
times Well dont I get a drink tonight
she asked boldly Many perils and mischances
Of course  anything you like he murmured
relief flooding over him
We cant expect him
to leave his customers 
Hugh said morosely Give
him a chance old chap
He ll be over Jim s A most
reliable chap when it comes
to picking up a small tip
Hugh nodded His face wore the
melancholy expression that was
habitual to him but his eyes showed
his inner excitement I know but from
the moment he walked out of here we
havent a shred of evidence to prove
what happened
For several minutes
he stared at his
reflection in the oval
mirror on the top of the chest
the toupee undoubtedly
improved his appearance and
made him look the years
younger But he was still no
sort of match for a young
and virile competitor and
he knew it
I cant do nothing with er 
 Dont worry Harry  the other
said quietly I wont make a fool
of myself Kitty needs a good
friend and I ll always be that
It would be safer under lock
and key for the time being
than behind a piece of panelling
which did not fit very securely
Tomorrow he would buy a heavy
padlock for the box and search for
a new hidingplace
Was it his imagination
or was the panel slightly
lopsided Leaping forward
with a choked sound he
grasped the oblong panel
and pulled it out The black
tin box was exactly as he
had left it
21 Methods of construction
Figure 3 illustrates the arrangement
of a single passage This can be
extended in length and width up to
the limit of manufactoring equipment
available The corrugation is machine
formed thus ensuring a high standard
of uniformity in height and fin
pitch
This type of construction
is used for gasgas and
gasliquid applications
Typical layouts are shown in
figures 9 and 10 Figure 9
shows an arrangement suitable
for twostream steady duty
Additional steady streams may be
included as C D or E to suit
requirements This type of arrange
ment is also used when dealing with
high pressure streams in all channels
For such pressures however
it is necessary to limit telling
span of the header tanks in
order to avoid excessive periphal
loadings in the plane of attachment
to the block Internal distributors
are necessary to spread the flow
and across the whole width of each
passage and these must be
adequate to withstand the
internal pressure loadings
These are discussed in
more detailed in later
sections The manufacture of
the heat exchangers involves
several distinct stages beginning
with the assembly and dipbrazing
of individual blocks ie tube plates
corrugations and edgeseals only
Two blocks are shown as a
series arrangement in Figure 12
and sixteen blocks in parallel in
figure 13 A more complex
arrangement is shown in figure
14 This complete assembly is
welded up to form a single unit
with flanged main connections

Tarrant gave a soft whistle
He patted the material gently
I shouldnt like to part with it
altogether If he had been asked
Tarrant would have said at
once that Haines could not
be bribed
Miss Paynter came in with a pile of
papers when Tarrant had seated himself at
his desk but he pushed them aside carelessly
It was an effort to discuss official work but
Tarrant thought that he had hidden his
perturbation
Oxenhams Face flushed slightly
I find your remark offensive
he said Commander Rogers felt
the situation was getting out of
hand After all he reflected
the police had nothing against
Tarrant
He ordered a drink and took it to
a table in a secludet corner
You must get rid of that coat he
said urgently Sir Cedric stroked the
material of the coat affectionately
Then if he ever used his
knowledge against you he d know
I could produce his confession and
he d go to gaol Tarrant stared at
his fatherinlaw unbelievingly
I Never looked on you as a romantist 
I felt it better you shouldnt know said Sir
Cedric defensively I hoped the police wouldnt question you
but I foresaw the psycho I didnt want them to get the
information out of you for I knew it would look suspicious
Plenty of people walked with a
limp and no link had been dis
covered between Tarrant and the
whitehaired man who had shown an
interest in Haines Anyhow he thought
it would be foolish to antagonise
a man who could be very awkward
Tarrant smiled  the idea seemed too
ridiculous Yet the questions had seemed to
him to indicate that Oxenham suspected him
At one time Tarrant had felt almost
sure that the CID must have learned of
his meetings with haines and know
about the blackmail
When he had brought another drink
Tarrant repeated at length the exchanges
which had taken place in Scotland Yard
Sir Cedric sat apparently unmoved but
at the close of the recital he gave a
loud chuckle
He had intended to do so
and only his own lack of
courage had made him surrender
the idea But he had withheld
nothing that would have
assisted Scotland Yard in
tracking down the murderer
Tarrant looked across
at Sir Cedric on the
other side of the table
and felt a rush of
affection for him I d
begun to suspect you
Cedric he apologised
He raved at me as if he were
unbalanced  He was a bit you know 
Sir Cedric took a sip at his sherry
A pity somebody saw us at Brighton 
he said
Chapter seventeen Oxenham felt incensed
that Tarrant should have been treated so
leniently and been permitted to dodge
questions The chief inspector could not argue
with Commander Rodgers but when Tarrant
had left the room he showed his irritation at the
interview had been conducted
Tarrant gave a stiff bow and went
out without a word He felt ashamed of
his behaviour It was no time to be
tactful and considerate of others
An insulting superiority had
been his best Defence
It is generally recognised as a second best
to much more radical schemes for transferring
the main burden of taxation from income to
expenditure Thus a capital gains tax for
all its obvious deficiencies is not without its
advocates in all parties
The only proposals for
change which can be
labelled practical are those
which involve the minimum
administrative complications
when set beside the existing
structure The objectives
It is the last of these four
objectives
The cost to the
Exchequer of placing
a ceiling of 15 s in the 
on direct personal taxation
would be about 20 m This
should be done The first is
the tax status of married women
One of the weaknesses of
Conservative Government has
been its reluctance to use
the tax system as an
instrument of policy as its
Labour predecessors did
freely On the contrary
conservatives have been content
to accept a system which
works directly against their
declared objective of more
widespread property ownership
The other taxes on
spending are the oil tax and
tariff charges which together
have an estimated yield of
580 m Food and sweets
fuel and light are not
taxed nor are books
magazines childrens
clothes some kitchen
equipment sheets and
towels
At present net company profits
are taxed at the standard income
tax rate plus a 12 12 per cent
profits tax The obvious candidate
to replace the present complicated
twopart system which includes investment
allowance reliefs would be the straight
corporation tax
But these have been successfully
overcome  abroad It seems
to me that discussion of changes
in this field can be most
usefully combined with a look at
Government finance Getting ready

the 1960s By David Howell
There are two basic points
which seem to be a necessary
preface to any sensible discussion
of taxation reform
Nigel I must say was very good about
it I knew how much he probably wanted
to sleep himself But almost gallantly he
said I ll show you
He had one of the better Kashmir
carpets on the floor His pictures and curtains
indeed I suppose the entire furnishings had
been selected personally After I had showered
I was found that the girl I had looked
at was in the bedroom making a pretence
of tidying my clothes
I hadnt for one moment thought
you would Nigel said
Bring your swimming costume if you
like We ve got a small pool over
on the other side of the estate
near the latex factory
It would be silly at
this point to let such trivialities
bother me I was even surprised that
they should The drinks were
served not by the Chinese
cookboy but by two young Malay
girls dressed gracefully in sarong
and kebaya
They were sitting over
the tea things when I
joined them And I said
to myself Oh God doesnt
the boy ever relax We ve
just had tea Nigel said
He was pacing up and down
the livingroom with obvious
irritation Did you sleep well
I enquired deliberately turning
away from him a little to look
through one of the windows
But as I succumbed to the
lewdness of their skilled ministra
tions I could not help wondering
about young Lees reactions to
arrangements
But the old man doesnt care
for using doublebarrelled names
as he calls them And I think I
agree with him That s why I use
just the plain Lee on my cards
Wouldnt mind a stengah myself
How about you Harry So they had
managed to come to the stage of
using each others Christian names
I noted Thanks Nigel he said
I shrugged a shoulder And I
thought to myself He may be still too
much of a new chum to see the
beauty  of the East There was still an
ease in our conversation but its scope
was restricted
I thought to myself A few
years in the East my boy and
you ll drink  I ve seen your
kind before After the curry

steps splashing behind him Like
a share of my mac a voice said
For a moment he didnt recognise him
Then he said
That s the first step Then he likes
to come along and kiss it better
He outdistanced his attendants with
Waters and said I ll have to
talk to the PM
The Chancellor was repeating an
argument which he had already
developed for an hour before
lunch A singularity bad time
The party s very restless you know
It s a sign of life  very encouraging
Have you spoken to them 
 Only at yesterdays meeting 
they re very restless Prime Minister
They feel that it is very old
fashioned  shooting down mobs
of natives
 I think it  s gone beyond that 
Prime Minister They feel pretty 
strongly about Africa On the whole 
the country is still in favour 
of moderation and Common sense 
After a minute of silence Melville
said Elisabeth  I must
talk to you She didnt answer
and he faced her On her bandages
there was a trace of blood her
cheeks were pale and her eyes had
heavy violet shadows beneath them
They want to ab
stain next week

chief to give them a

then said
Ormston stepped down from devil
dais into the Central aisle
taking the longest route through
the room to the public exit
He was greeted on all sides with
friendly smiles
I feel rather like a father
whose child is bleeding to
death His simile disturbed
him it evoked other associations
and he hurriedly drained the
glass of water The Prime
Minister said nothing and
Ormston continued
Yet he might be wrong A hope began
to rise in his viscera Perhaps he
was mistaken Perhaps that was the
origin of her hatred which had
then led him by her subconscious
design to the diaries
The ducks had retreated
to the reeds and the water
had black reflecth Others
picknicked close by  the whole
a picture of domestic living
in the open air As Melville
walked a thunderclap awoke
the prostrate figures
At that point you get a moral
revulsion against force  especially if
it makes taxation rise What could
Melville have done to avoid all this
The Prime Minister looked puzzled
and said
He liked his cadenced voice
his easy undeferential manner
and his pleasant open face
with the blues scar at the side
of his head In Africa Yes
He slowly let go of her
wrists and rose from the bed
His gaze still held her
expressionless eyes and he
withdred to the door Then he
went to his study his
certainties complete
But the leaves gave off a warm
soaking smell the pain in his head
lifted and he felt refreshed Elite

When greenhouse plants go to rest
S Clapham During the winter the
summerflowering greenhouse perennials
are of course at rest but this does not
mean that they need no attention
at all
Afterwards they should romp
away in spring This week in
your garden By Percy Thrower MDH
Flowers We are now at the beginning
of the planting season for trees shrubs
and roses
But Cupressus lawsoniana and
Thuja plicata make fine hedges
particularly where a screen of
fair size is required The preparation
for the planting of trees shrubs
and roses should always be thorough
because these are permanent
plants which cannot be disturbed
once they are in
Fruit For fruit also this is the ideal
planting season and work can continue
at any time when the soil is in reasonable
condition until the end of March For a
North wall I recommend a Morello cherry
for an East wall a plum or greengage
and for a South or westfacing wall
a peach nectarine or apricot
These I shall now put
on a shelf near the glass and
leave them there for the winter
From these stock cuttings I
shall take further cutting in
spring as I find that the
springstruck cuttings make
finer plants than thoose rooted
in autumn
It is not in general wise to move
herbaceous plants in the middle of the
winter This is true of some veronicas
and also of the larger flowered
escallonias In northern and eastern
districts the large flowered hydrangeas
are also safer with some protection
All ground should then be dug
at least to the full depth of a
spade and left rough during the
winter  so that frost wind
and rain may break it up It
is particularly important to dig
heavy land in autumn because
there is nothing better than
frost and wind to break down
the lumps of clay
This  may be bought at

and the transoms to shape as
in the detailed drawings I use a

I prefer spruce when available As
will be seen in the plan the transoms have

chines are morticed into this and butt up
against the transom
I have built many of these little
craft in this country and particularly
in Canada for use by commercial

Over there the cost is about  17 00

6 0s  0d  Prices of course depend
on local availability of materials
and  there are many ways in which
costs can be saved

The edges of the

Dont forget to cut out on

For instance in Canada
we use galvanised nails
in place of screws
We just bend them over and
clamp firmly by using a
hammer on each side Over
here I ve always used brass
screws which are more expensive
I prefer spacing screws 3 in apart

The analysis will show
that the early Church not
unnaturally adopted the position that
failure to see the messianic
character of his work was
really caused by the peoples
own blindness The first
summary is Mark 41012
The inserted verse properly denotes
a warning against taking spirituals
privilege for granted
But here it actually increases
the sense of privilege which directly
contradicts our Lords intention
But Matthew has made it underline
the good fortune of the disciples as
a privileged elite
It was a natural position
to take once the teacher
himself had withdrawn A
concomitant of the final stage
is the secttype doctrine of
the Church The Church is a
privileged elite having access
to knowledge denied to
those outside its ranks
It is the full and final revelation
cf Heb 12a In the first line
QUOT has a roughly equivalent
meaning to QUOT in the second
To apply it to the parabolic method
is a further refinement effected
with the aid of the
Septuagint rendering
And it also shows how Jesus
was truly acting as the
Messiah in the time before
his crucifixion We have now
arrived at an intelligible
reason for kekrummena as
a rendering of QUOT
This implies an interpretation of the
whole psalm in terms of our Lords
redeeming work The psalm is a poetical
narrative of the acts of God in redemption
The whole thing is thus an expression
of faith that he who acted in this way
can do so again
Thus this version
disregards the context
presumably intentionally
Nevertheless there is evidence
that this psalm was used by
at any rate one circle in the
Church with closer attention
to this meaning
The purpose is pictorial
rather than apologetic The
details of the life of Jesus are already
present in the revelation given
to the prophets But Matthew
scarcely realizes that his use of
the verse accords ill with its real
meaning
The keyword for
Matthew is wen parabolais
As the whole of the first
line is identical with the
Septuagint it probably represents
the final stage of the
adaptation of the text
This is to make it specifically
applicable to the use of
parables
Thes changes thus cut out any further
mention of the disciples which had been
specifically developed in the former summary and
place the emphasis solely on the intentional
obscurity of Jesus public teaching
In fact the application of
Isa 534 to healing
miracles is not really appropriate
We have previously decided
that the proper Christian
understanding of this verse is
the atoning efficacy of the
passion
They established it and the Jews took it
upon them This is said to mean They
the heavenly court established above
that which the Jews took upon them
the reading of the book of Esther down
here below
Even more significant is the fact
that the proof texts from Boaz and
the angel are quoted in support of this
very thesis that greeting should be
given by the divine name in an
anonymous Mishnah
3 Second proof text A
Boaz B Angel Question
Answer 4 Third proof text
Question What is the meaning
of beli dai
The question is then asked
To this the reply is given that
from the verse dealing with Boaz
there is no proof of divine approval
only that Boaz used this form
of greeting
This is the verse The Gemara
then asks What is the meaning
of more than sufficiency 
Heb beli dai Rami Bar Rabh
replies  Until your lips are
worn out in saying
From the above it
follows that here once again we
have a good illustration of how
a sugya has been fashioned from
material already in the hands
of the redactors The sugya is
built around the saying of R Joshua
b Levi
The question and answer
with regard to the need for the
text of the angel are quoted
here in the same words in
which they are quoted in the
discussion on the Mishnah Or
it is possible that our sugya
contains the original question and
answer and this is quoted in the
other sugya
But how could he have known this
perhaps she had consorted with some other
man This proves according to the Gemara
that the holy spirit manifested itself
in the court of Shem which
flourished in the days of Judah
But it was a heavenly voice
which said She is his mother
Raba objects that there is no proof
from the texts quoted With regard
to Samuel the singular form may
have been used because the whole
people of Israel are referred
to in the singular as they are
in another verse
To this Rabh Joseph raises
an objection and Abaye
replies by referring his master
to the saying of R Joshua b
Levi The only difficulty
here is that if Rabh Joseph
is prepared to disagree with
Rabh there is no reason why
he should not disagree

He separated three from the pile and
contemptuously threw them on the floor
Go on buy yourself a RollsRoyce he sneered
Dont go away I might want you later
on
You dont think I enjoy your

Gaffer scribbled on a slip of paper
and tucked the banknotes into

Some thirty minutes later he

On that day a villager in a
cottage turned a tap  and the
utility of Wilborough Pond was
after a thousand years ended
Thereafter it became a piece
of the landscape
In most cases it is consigned to the
kindly effacing earth in others
chickens and birds are the agents of
disposal One day the surveyors arrived
This was their lowest point and after
the spanning of our little valley
they could once more rise
They appeared to look elsewhere
indeed until I realized afresh as
you have to that all birds look
at you from the sides of their
heads
If this chapter reads like a
successful rout I am sorry to have
given you the wrong impression Those
Chinese geese finally fooled me and
everyone else That was one of the turning
points of my life as a ponddweller
They cajoled wheedled
entreated tinkered Eventually
they knocked off for a smoke
and a cup of tea This campaign
proceeded for an entire
morning I was amazed at
the workmens stolid patience
Whenever they appeared
on the pond and I was
present I threw a sprinkle
of small grit around them
At first they exhibited no
emotion apart from
comical surprise I persisted
in this sprinkling campaign
for nearly a whole winter
not without success
I realized that I had had a fortunate
escape when he also added that they were
the only two survivors of a brood of
eight Actually the latter was my only
course since they had allready decided
either to attack or hoot at all comers
In villages it marks the end of
water as a precious liquid to be
dispensed frugally weighed out drop
by drop Living at Pond Cottage I
had been able to appreciate my own
ample supplies while viewing the bucket
dipping villagers from my window
The trench remained
obstinately full the water
seeped in as fast as it was
pumped away For some weeks
the matter remained thus while
the supervisors who occasionally
arrived in shining saloon cars scratched
their heads over the problem
With a mechanical digging monster
eating up earth and rocks with equal
ease they dug a deep trench on the side of
the road furthest from the ponds edge
It remained thus for a whole summer
The darkness must have put him off
his stroke or the chains were of
too honest a brand It took two
coopers or hoopers to get him out
I thought that this might possibly mark
the opening of a new phase of more
tractable and nourishing
relationships
Fifteen years ago I was
pretty innocent You will have to
believe me when I tell you that
my suspicions were not yet
aroused Over coffee and pretzels
we waked I complimented him on
the improvement in his English
I am not sure what the hound wanted of
Thompson but what Howie required of me was
very simple He wanted me to act The
relationship began in the primary School
Howie was a graduate who had failed to get
a grammar School post
He enquired of a few local
hagiologists as to whether St
David had ever gone around in
chains They said no all
agreeing that David had been
a fairly limber intriguer with
a way of keeping on the
right side of the gyves
In the original version the
landlord gets his quittance by some
bit of intercession from on high
Howie had favoured a bolt but this
would have been hard to stage so he
fell back on a stroke
Usually it was in the stand at a football
match in some billiards saloon or strip
show To think I said to him one day
that in a few moments these microfilmed
working drawings of Mappins improved
percolator will be in Moscow
That was me back to base
The gibbet is a fair way from
the gaol and the chains are
heavy I stare at the saint
I am trying to remember
something
And at that moment Mr Rudi Smith
announced himself and strode into the Office
Please see he said holding up a square of shiny
material it dont creasing it dont shrinking it dont
ripping
Our mesalliance slowly
collapsed and until last
week I had almost
succeeded in forgetting
all about it What brought
it back were the recorded
impressions made by BBC
reporters of their May day
visit to Moscow
I nodded my agreement It is
a new technique evolved in the
Kiev University faculty of psychological
warfare It is called brainwashing
He seemed particularly interested in
Wedgwood beakers a Decca recordplayer
and Coopers Oxford marmalade
The bomb means military
stalemate he said From now
on we fight for eoconomic
supremacy in the worlds markets
in the uncommitted nations We
Russians have no experience
of  consumer goods
He wrote patriotic playlets But I
played along with Howie The play
cycle he had written had two wheels
anguish and insurrection and I was
the boy who did the major pedalling
He had even given me an
address to which I could go and
apply for some sort of honest
work The ghostess By Betty
James And added my teenage

already had a bad press before
reports were received yester
day of alleged indiscipline
by some of its troops in
Elisabethville
After looking upon such a
prospect Bertrand Russell has
chosen to take the way of
civil disobedience and go to
prison Why this should move
our allies or Mr Khrushchev  or
indeed what it  would mean
 is not clear
But he has never
signed the cheque The jolt had
to come and unfortunately it
does not seem to have come as
cheaply as at first appeared Dr
OBrien may have taken one of
the the tides in the affairs of men
omitted Katanga might have
straggled on to a worse tragedy
But they were so convinced and they have had to
take the consequences Meanwhile in Germany
itself the course of the campaign has dismayed a good 
many people they too will be glad
To Germanys Western allies the
campaign has been a millstone
weighing down and almost paralysing
their efforts to work out sensible ways
of dealing with the Berlin crisis 
It need not have been such a burden
if Western Governments had not
been convinced
To be able to say New York next week is
an important advance We must not be
overconfident that this meeting will lead
on to further and decisive ones but
without it we could not look for them
But this is not the way for
the CongoKatanga dispute
to be ended The key to a solution
surely lies in the continued
recognition by the United nations
of M Tshombe as Pregnent
of Katanga province
Dr OBrien has praised
the valour of Katanga soldiers
M Tshombe should not encourage
them to drive the point home
Instead of putting up a desperate
resistance he should spend an
hour reading the Nigerian
constitution
No wonder he tried to
have me suffocated
back last summer
Must have thought I d
rumbled him right
from the start Sir Cedric
had never spoken of such
a call on the murdered
man
In the end he pieced
it all together The Caxtons
had two boys  Michael
and Derek Pete First met
them at school It was a
good school I sent him to
one of the best
I wasnt at the wharf at any time on
Wednesday That is the truth so help me God 12
There it is Passon commented afterwards
She is a business woman
She s as good a worker as you could
wish for She speaks our language Mag s One

much longer Nor me What s

The long brutal winter ended at last
When Nick returned home he found
that his mother was seriously ill
Outside the family he
began to pass himself off as
Michael Caxton The father was
welloff and easygoing He was
easy meat for Pete He sponged off
him until he died just after the
war
I m going to get myself

next day he brought home
a woman in her middle
thirties and took her
straight to his mothers
bedside Mum This is Maggie
You get right out of this Rose You
leave me in peace Rose took one breath
of the stagnant air You  you polecat 
she screeched and retreated without argument
The two of us will sleep in the front room
downstairs  You wont ever shift him Nick
patted her We ll manage Just you take
it easy
This room and me understands one
another Sam sank back on his
pillow Oh my God All right you
win With that settled Fred was
soon married
Starmouth managed to win
her confidence She showed
him photographs He found out
that the name of her house 
Grand Greve  was taken
from a bay in one of the
Channel Islands
He argued that it was the
only place where he could be
safe from Rose See here Sam
Nick began You know
Fred s getting spliced
After her busband
died her brain began to
fade At times she thought
Pete was really her own son
Other times she remembered
that both Michael and Derek
were dead She couldnt
work it out
Another was the body
fetching up on the
mooringhook  practically
where it started from
And you finding out about
the spy at the Marshams
Passon said Just a stroke
of luck sir Tong said
Take trees He rattled on
happily Trees have got the
right idea A tree s got more
sense than some people think
A tree dont have to worry
Now he grew more and more
agitated  The time for my revenge was
just round the corner He had seen my
son and another girl in intimacy My
chance had come at last
Against this background
must be taken Mr  Kaundas

he is doing is in the name

She felt chilled to the bone and
somewhat depressed She was
engaged to Nigel had been for two
years If we get married old girl
you ll have to stop that lark I can
tell you
I Just thought I ll see he told
her and suddenly seized her in an
embrace which really hurt Mine Nigel
Lester had decided with a sigh of
satisfaction and then regarded the ring
which he retrieved from his pocket
If it is  she laughed uncertainly 
you can have your ring back
She loosened the halfhoop of
diamonds on her left hand third
finger and held it out to him still
playfully
Who s he Though
Diana knew the name of
every member of the staff
distinguished or not Nigel often
had to think hard to sort them
out He s the carrotty lad
isnt he he now demanded
My white or my black
Nigel enquired Now I wonder I
wore at that particular
surgery You are a fool darling
Di said happily
Really Nigel cocked one
eyebrow Actually she was
brunette at the roots and I had
a redhead on the other arm
He would have told you this
too
I Only wish I could go with
you Doctor Wills If you re
making improper suggestions 
 It would make me more
interesting I suppose she
enquired archly
Nigel was the hospitals
junior medical Officer Lukes
Surgery goes on for hours If they
get in before eightthirty even though
they re standing on one anothers toes
I ve got to see em
It was Nigels car anyway
NUF 121 He probably loaned
his car to somebody Phil He s
always doing that Young
Gubbins shrugged I didnt see
his face Di but it certainly
looked like Nigel from the back
But I want it she
protested It s my ring
You just gave it back to
me I didnt I was
joking
When we re married we wont have
these explosions of emotion will we
 No he eyed her strangely I wish we
were married Di Like a patient wishes
his operation was over
Nigel  She gasped I didnt mean to
behave like anything of the kind I was only
joking Well dont It s miserable enough my
having to take my leave in the autumn without
you trying to be bright and gay about it
Dianas Face was
drained of colour She
was almost angry for
a moment Her hair was
of a chestnut brown
shade which glinted with
gold in the evenings he had
noticed
I think so I got a good look
at her But if Nigel wasnt
there it isnt important is it
No Di said immediately Yees
he lowered his eyes and kissed her
on the mouth an act of devotion he
didnt overindulge
But somehow he d kept hoping
he could be wrong He lit a cigarette and put
his final question How are they going to do it
How do they knockout the transformer
How far are we from the
PolleyBland plant Grundy
swallowed and mumbled a reply
so low and hoarse that Kennan
had to strain to hear We re
in South  Ayrshire
The Luger slug had made a neat round
entry just below the collarbone Easing him
up Kennan found the bullets exit point a more
ragged wound in from the shoulderblade
The lights flickered then held steady
Goldie lunged to his feet again
the razor flashing in a frantic
sidestroke as his pursuer loomed
over him He kicked the razor clear
then stood back panting for
breath gesturing with the long
black muzzle of the Luger
The thug collapsed with a
whistling moan and Kennan tore the
Luger from the mans suddenly limp
hand There was no time for rejoicing
but the hard firm shape of the
automatic sent a new confidence
surging through his body
Now however he had another
problem what to do with the
two surviving crooks Goldie He
could be  discounted for
some time and his bonds should
hold until he was collected by
MacTaggarts men
I m going to lift you and
get you on to one of the beds
Understand Grundy coughed
and gave a faint mumble of
acknowledgement He wasnt
heavy
For a moment staring at it
he thought he d have to go back
and try to find a key
But Benson had obviously decided
he d never be locked in from inside
The ninemillimetre bullets
smashed the chain as if it had
been plastic and free though the
chain still dangled he threw himself
across the floor towards the
entrance Leo Grundy materialized
there at the same second
In her broad Ayrshire
dialect she demanded in turn
are you one of them Americans
from the air base at Prestwick
He shook his head and turned
back to the phone as MacTaggarts
voice crackled over the wire
But Kennan still had his
wallet and money The farmhouse
was inside
While he waited for the operator
at police headquarters in Glasgow
to locate Superintendent
MacTaggart Kennan asked his
audience
Kennan dragged a heavy
boulder over to the shaft
doorway placing it in such a
way that the door couldnt
swing shut Then shoving the
Luger into the waistband of
his trousers he set off
for the road
Hell Kennan I  I d tell you
if I could Kennan tried again
It was eightythirty  only half an
hour since the brooch and fish hook
trap had sprung
If you stay still you ve a chance
Try getting away and you ll haemorrhage
within a hundred yards Grundy nodded
He found a clean shirt in a small
suitcase tore it into strips and used
the  resultant rags as bandages
The kniveman thug was dead
It was a moment or two before
Kennan understood He felt sick But
there were other things to do than
crouch over the probably unlamented
remains of Cutter Malone
It is true that Sir Graham
said there is at the moment
an awful mess up in the measure
ment of temperatures This how
ever seems a matter of the
convenience of specialists
They live in a
perpetual State of mental laager
They can see Mr Luthuli only over the
sights of their rifles Even then permission
given to leave the native land which is
half a gaol for him is grudging and

give the Government an extra
excuse for counselling patience
until the next report from
the Molony Committee Comprehensive
legislation is obviously preferable
Unanimity will come less easily

But in this life is it not lawful
to seek the happiness of others On stern
Kantian grounds no Our only desire for
others should be that they observe the moral
law
The kind of good preached
by Kant and Coleridge
seemed to him vague and
undefined But everyone knew
what pleasure was Here was a goal
with no mystical nonsense about it
Of Christ as in some sense continuing
his work of redemption by endlessly
offering himself to God in organic
Union with his members
We must keep this dualism in
mind when we come to consider
what Kant says about the relation
of goodness and happiness
In the first he had shown
himself a revolutionary The
inhabitants of Koenigsburg set their
watches by him when they saw this mild
inoffensive man take his regular walk
He seems to have accepted the
syllogism I Only desire what gives me
the greater pleasure Therefore whatever
I do I do because it gives me the
greater pleasure What is the greatest
pleasure
Here we have a sharp
dualism Kant finds it rather
difficult to answer the question
have I any motive at all when I
obey the moral law I am not
concerned with any consequence
that may follow
A E Taylor has said
that what distinguishes
religion from morality is
that the former says What
ought to be exists
Kant makes a move in that
direction There is another
point at which he swerves
from the strict Stoic creed
Two famous examples present
themselves in the critique of
pure reason where he is analysing
the fact of knowledge First of all
the case of the senses and
the understanding They seem
to have no Common root
We get a clear result of
his system when he speaks of
children Kant And the utilitarians
There are many ways of being hard
to understand One is due to style
Bentham would have done
well to consider the romantic
movement which he so much
despised That World was
not wholly closed to John
Stuart Mill Brought up
in the straitest sect of the
Benthamites he literally
collapsed after a diet of
pushpin as good as poetry
and fortythree motives
for obeying the law
I must therefore I can This
proves human freedom But the
law commands that I shall
be absolutely good I suppose
he might have answered yes
survival after death and
unending improvement need
not mean perfect happiness
there any more than here
He must be left with
something to live by
As Kant says with a regal
gesture So we have got
back to the existence of
God but the God of the
moral law
When he learned what was causing
the commotion he became greatly alarmed
and after the body had been taken
to St Thomass Hospital it was his
griefstricken duty formally to identify
Elizabeth Camp  aged thirtythree  the
girl who was to have
But both purse and ticket  and the
packages  were gone when the body
was found at Waterloo  Neither
the sisters nor Mr Berry thought
it likely that she had been
carrying much money  A porter at
Hounslow supported the sister  s
statement that Elizabeth Camp had
been alone in her compartment when
the train left  but this did not help much
since it
Even the bone cufflinks found beside the body 
which had at first been considered as
belonging to the killer  proved yet another
red herring  for it was learned that
they had been borrowed by Elizabeth
Camp from one of her sisters  A young
man from Reading named Marshall
There has always been something
sinister in the idea of tunnels
Some thought that the result
would be all sorts of horrible illnesses
brought on by the confined atmosphere
The mere thought of subterranean travel
gave others a feeling of  danger
Her sister saw her to the station
helping her with some of her packages This sister
was able to establish that she had carried
a green purse and had bought a railway
ticket
She had been struck several
times with a blunt instrument
and her head was smashed in
There were signs of a violent
struggle blood on the cushions
and floor and the remains of
her broken umbrella
For all that  as
far as England is concerned 
there have been only two
occasions on which a
body has been found in
a tunnel in circumstances
pointing to murder 
The first was that of
Mr Gold  in the famous
According to Miss Hone she
had not been carrying a hand
bag but she believed she had
had a small purse Mary had
certainly taken some money
with her for the police traced
her movements to a shop in
Clapham where she had bought
some chocolate
So the body of this small girl
with the blue eyes and long
brown hair in a bun at the
back of her head remained a
mystery until later the following
day  During that time a description
of the girl was circulated 
and a Mr Robert Money
came forward to
They also had to cope with
the usual flood of rumours  so
me well meant  some mischievous 
including one that a man had been
seen fleeing from Vauxhall station
on the Thursday evening  with blood
actually dripping from his hands 
The inquest was opened on
February 17  but
Some thought that the result would be all
sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
confined atmosphere  The shareholders who
travel by it will be so heartily sick 
what with the foul air  smoke and sulphur 
that the mention
The dead woman had been
engaged once before  to a
barman named brown All the
while the police were casting
about for a man who had been
seen leaving the train at
Wandsworth
At a spot on the embankment
between Putney and Wand
worth they found a blood
stained pestle such as
chemists use with some hairs
sticking to it The murder
weapon more than likely and
 perhaps evidence enough
to have brought a killer
The present State of the
gospel is the result of an
accidentprone history The
ingenuity of the theories
is impressive and is the
best argument against them
If the history of the gospel
has been as fortuitous as
they suppose rational criticism
is impossible
PWith so many problems to solve it
would be AM a great help to
select some one problem which might
be the key to all the others and
begining there If there is any
such keyproblem then it is
undoubtedly the problem of the unity
of the gospel
The other form of Book was the
codex In this the sheets were
bound together down one edge much
as they are in modern books
Normally the sheets were bound in
groups called quires and the
quires were stitched together to
make a Book
Most of those who expound a
theory of textual dislocation
take it for granted that the
Gospel was written entirely
by one author befor the
disturbance took place but
a few leave it open to
suppose that the original
book had been
The difficulties which are felt by
modern critics are due to the Book
being read and examined as it was
never meant to be There is some truth
in this contention and one must always
remember that no Book of the new
testament was written with the special
interests of a modern critic in mind
Some codices were made
up of double sheets folded
and stitched through the fold
The difference between the codex
and the roll is always clear Against
these advantages the codex was
fragile and might be bulky
To understand how this is
possible it is necessary to
examine the text of the gospel
Chapter 3 The text of the fourth
gospel The fourth gospel was
almost certainly written in Greek
The bar was the
commonest marking
but others were also
used Frequently para
graphos markings were
omitted Proffessor E G
Turner is inclined to
take the view that the
original of the gospel would
be unmarked
There would be no
spaces between words
such as we are accustomed
to see and punctuation
would be kept to a minimum
The comma the full stop
the stop the colon and
the interrogation mark are
all modern additions to
the text
The writing instrument was a
stylus a wedgeshaped pen cut
from a reed The ink was a
mixture of carbon black in
water with gum Arabic as a
solvent The paper would be
papyrus or parchment and the
form of the Book a roll
or codex
The exponent of such a theory
has seen some regularities in
the structure of the gospel The
regularities are not simple not
are they continuous The third
type of theory would account of the
difficulties of the fourth gospel in
terms of its having been at one time
a shorter Book than it now is

 Dear serious Father  
she said She thought 
 How much I love you How 
many railway employees 
read books on philosophy 
Her father had given himself 
a firstrate education by 
reading good books and 
remembering what was in them 
Neither was daring nor held
views beyond the rest of the
people with whom they mixed
Her mother was barely a gene
ration removed from people
who considered that a foreigner
in the family was not quite
respectable
The train roared in with
a rush of pungent air Vera sat
down on her comfortable seat
closed her eyes and thought a
little sadly about her parents Green
Park Station was only a short
walk to her hotel but the streets
had not yet been cleared
He doesn  t like it but this is 
a special occasion When are we going to 
see you How long are you staying 
 The questions tumbled out  Only 
two days moher 
There was no doubt Sir
Arthur was pleased to see her
No doubt too that he had been
conducting a test of Hairmone 
 His head was covered with
coppery red hair which made him
look many years younger
Houses were  like people 
she thought sometimes up 
sometimes down At the air terminal 
Vera hailed a taxi and gave the 
name of an hotel off Curzon Street 
It had one been a private home 
and now was a digniflied discreet 
place catering for people who 
could no longer afford to keep town 
houses 
No There was a pause
Vera knew at once that her
mother was thinking there
must be something wrong between
her daughter and soninlaw
Her father could never bring him
self to do anything imperfectly
The house was one of a 
terrace and was kept 
spotless Her mother often 
exuded to Vera  s sensitive 
nostrils a smell of carbolic soap 
and metal polsh which were 
constantly in her hands 
Nor had she told her parents
that she was coming For the
first few hours she felt like a
foreigner in her own London
Yet it stuck her as odd
that the shops in the suburban
shopping centres resembled
those of an English village
Veras Old irritation with her
mother returned for a moment
Everything is absolutely fine Vera
assured her I have a wonderful job
I am secretary to Mr Arzrumian
She would visit her parents that
afternoon Tomorrow she would arrange
to see Sir Arthur After that her schedule
would look after itself Her hotel room proved
to be ideal for complete relaxion
He had thick rather long 
grey hair He wore a grey 
Savile Row suit of exactly 
the same colour as his hair 
His eyes were greyishblue  
the colour of a winter sky 
Vera felt that they were at once on
a far better footing than they had ever
been Mother and daughter entered the
house arminarm and the questions
began You re so beautifully dressed
she said and added quite inconse
quentially cant you stay the night
Mr Arzrumians Secretary I
would like to make an appointment
with Sir Arthur The secretary had
been alerted to the impending
visit of Arzrumian One moment
she said
He s involved in several of
my business ventures but I
have to twist his arm to
make him take on new commitments
That said Sir Arthur is the
penalty of success 
Next morning Vera walked through the 
Park as far as Buckingham Palace 
and down to the ornamental shape 
She found it exhilarating to be back 
again Although it was early in 
the year tourists were wandering about 
already 
But she decided she could
not face it She must avoid outside
distractions at all costs London was
like a sleeping princess awakened
to life and beauty by the kiss of
the sun
People were so kind I felt like
a shipwrecked mariner who had been
rescued by a luxury liner Stranger
pressed boxes of chocolates on me

Don Felipe said quietly She is
desolate as indeed I am myself
This is awful Julia exclaimed in
consternation
Don Felipe had begun to peel
himself a peach He completed
the delicate operation before
he answered Then he laid down
his silver knife and looked
at Julia directly as he spoke
She bowed gravely to Julia
acknowledging the girls greeting
and began to serve in her usual
silence Julia had already realised
there was something quite offbeat
about Dona Beatriz so she was
careful to address only Don Felipe
at her side throughout the meal
On Monday we begin our new
arrangement of course I had thought 
He named a figure which Julia knew was
generous in the extreme So you will
be here at the same time then
Naturally it was a tremendous
grief We had hoped for sons to
carry on our name The best thing
we can do seems to be to
concentrate on work doesnt it
Ah yes You propose to sail
home in the Juno do you not
Thats right alas And you
wont want me here tomorrow as
it s Sunday of course
Julia felt a trifle
uncomfortable I didnt
really pay great attention
she began but imperiously
he cut her short We will
discuss this matter later

private

out two glass dishes Icecream Julia insisted
They both thought it quite funny when they
discovered chocolate was the same in both
languages
Then he lifted his head and asked
quietly I wonder what tales you
have heard about me Miss Barclay
Well I dont quite know  Julia
hesitated
Pepita stood there staring at Julia
with all the happiness draining out
of her pretty little face Her black
eyes filled with anguish the
tears brimming over and coursing
down her cheeks
Julia lifted her up and she
immediately wound her small
arms round the girls neck
nuzzling her cheek snuggling against
her hair Don Felipe smiled as he
watched them Pep restored he
said
Julia felt depressed and a trifle
sad as Luis conveyed her to Don

sighed thinking how unkind fate could be
at times The morning began just the
same as the others

might continue to live at the Hotel

enjoying the climate and the
friendly beach and cafe life

thank you  I cant bear to

repetition Meanwhile we should
have met the Russians headon
in midGermany which might lead
to anything Even at this late
stage there was no working
arrangement as to the details
of this encounter
It was of our disjointed times that
one should be kept from sleep by the
deafening chorus of a positive nuisance
of nightingales Until a night of no more
music when one realized almost with
regret that the Russians must have
overrun the transmitter

For this fairly small group comparisons
between different years cannot be made so
precisely as in groups with a defined
number of children In 1959 th
households in this group contained
slightly more children average 464
than in the previous year
average 453
Percentage standard errors
of these estimates are given
in table 10 of appendix A All
types of household spent
more than in the previous
year except families with
three children whose
expenditure had risen sharply
in 1958
78 The younger childless
couples are broadly comparable
in age and family income
with the family households
so that differences in food
expenditure may be associated
with the presence of children
The analysis has been repeated for
1957 1958 and 1959
The lowest estimates were
for protein and calcium in
families with four or more
children 82 and 81 per
cent respectively The war
damage may however be
made good by works which
include alterations and
additions
Consumption by younger
childless couples declined
throughout this period  but that of
the smaller families was maintained
excepted for the slight fall in 1959
In the largest families  particularly
those containing four or more children 
there was a tendency for consumption
to increase between 1955 and
The price ranges for milk 
cheese  sugar  bread and flour
were very narrow  For most other
foods younger childless couples p l

The relative expenditure per
child declined from 1952 to
1956  but rose in 1957 when the
subsidy on welfare and national
dried milk was reduced since
1957 in it has again declined 
Most of the average
expenditure associated with a
child was on cereal foods 
potatoes and milk frm for
fresh green vegetables  fruit 
cheese  fish and
79 Table 30 shows the energy value
and nutrient content of the diets of
households of different composition
Since physiological requirements vary widely
with go sex and level of activity comparisons
between families of different compositions
are only apposite when considered in
relation to needs
Details of expenditure and con
sumption per head are given in tables
28 and 29 Most groups obtained
slightly less liquid water than in
1958 the greatest decrease from 524
to 508 pints per head per week
occuring in younger twoadult
households
73 All groups spent more on
fish and most increased their
consumption particularly of
canned fish Eggs were
cheaper than in the previous
year and consumption in
creased in nearly all groups
despite fewer free supplies
All types of household
benefited from the improved
supplies and lower prices
of fresh fruit compared
with 1958  but the increase
in consumption was least
in families containing
children  77  Total bread
consumption was virtually
unchanged

By D MacKney The
glacial events which have led
to the formation of the
midland plain are controversial
in detail but some conclusions
are universally accepted The
deposits which form the plain
have been derived from
the Palaeozoic rocks of Wales
and the North
Extensive areas in
Delamere were planted with
oak early in the 19th
century and more or less
cleared in the early years

the thought that this was precisely
the remark she had made to Guy

that came into her head Oh

added i the same casual
tone She s not returning to

Also from Orkney is a wooden
bismar or Danish steelyard used by

The principle was known to early Aryan
tribesmen who found its simplicity
convenient for their nomadic way or life

apprentices Among the cruder
examples are the wooden butter

Sanders A century and more

They would be looseleave
books Of course there are
many practical objections to
such a method of printing
but we must ask how the
reader overcome the handicaps
which the present design of
books imposes on him
Thus reading for understanding means
taking items of knowledge to pieces
as we read them and seeing how the
pieses are connected It does not at
all correspond to the needs of the
readers mind
Or like a whale Polonius Now the
whale the camel etc were not
in the sky The clouds are mere
aggregates of waterdrops The whale
etc were in the minds of Hamlet
and Polonius
Can we now put forward
any reasonably clear picture of
this basis of mental
phenomena Where has psychology
got to this in its theories of
mind Are there any ultimate units
of mind akin to the atoms of matter
These interpretations are
called schemas or more
pedantically schemata At one
time mind used to be
identified with consciousness
But consciousness simply
refers to the stream of
changing experiences
As a psychologist I am
constantly encountering this
tendency in friends and
acquaintances This is what I
mean by getting things the
wrong way around And so
they prefer objective methods
At one time it was thought
that mind could indeed be
analysed into discrete bits 
These bits were identified as
elementary sensations  these
were thought to combine
together to form compound
experiences by analogy with
the way atoms of
He must become a critic
of his own methods and
an experimenter in the
discovery of better methods
he cannot expect the
professional psychologist to tell
him wat is best for him
because every individual
is different
It rests on the mistaken
notion that the teacher has
something which he is passing on
to the learner This is only
superficially true The learner is
not a passive recipient He already
has a certain store of knowledge
and a certain vocabulary
This is the important fact
about mental phenomena The physical
cloud in the sky is just itself made
of waterdrops The mental cloud is
a multiplicity But it is experienced
1 as a cloud 2 as a whale
3 as a camel and so on
But this view led to too many
difficulties and was finally
abandoned Nevertheless the search
for basic units of mind has gone
on and will doubtless continue
for it is the aim of science
to discover ultimate units
These are 1 the philosophers
approach 2 the psychologists
approach 3 the teachers ap
proach He must be his own
philosopher his own psychologist
and his own teacher
It is known as the schema
The following conversation
between Hamlet and
Polonius shows that Shakes
peare had at any rate an
intuitive grasp of the
notion Hamlet Do you see

in shape of a camel
You will then be a

World will be at your feet One

and its many meanings can be

cumbersome and abstract terms which
then introduce new difficulties

Under Rufus Horgan he
said Andrea flinched For a
moment she had forgotten
that and now the sting
in his voice made her
think he was trying to
hurt her
Do please Mark said curtly
It seemed to take hours of coming
and going and all the time he stood
there until he must have known by her
silence that it was all cleared up
The guy neednt know we hate
his guts for coming here
instead of you You want me
in on your first conference
OK Thanks a lot  Mark
must have said goodbye then
for the American put down

She was strangely breathless
As for Mark unless it was a

white Was it true that Pauline
had dashed im in response to
a shout from him when every
thing cascaded down off the
top of the bookcase
I m sure everyone feels the
same  They re taking it badly

latest theory about the leakage 
that it was just
coincidence  was right
Knocked something over and turned
the whole room into a shambles apparently
Pauline stooped and began dabbing at the
water on the carpet with a scarf she had
pulled from her neck

glass blocks of the factory were

Andrea the next few days were terrible
Andrea saw him drive up and get out
briskly Dr Pentland has some jobs
for you Miss Holme he said
striding in
I didnt hear you Pink cream
and scarlet they were lying
everywhere Dr Horgan said
you wanted me  she got out
I do
She stiffened listening
Oh it s you Mark she
heard him say Still making
out Fine Something you
want us to do here
Then the two men came into the Office
and Gus was introducing her Dr Horgan 
Eye behind his spectacles were friendly
and his smile kind Dr Pentland told me
about you Miss Holme he said
shaking hands
And have one of the girls from the typing
school warned she may be needed
Mark will want you with him and
Horgan quite a bit I ve To run the
show here until he has everything
sewn up
Dont worry Andrea wheeled and
went off leaving them to say
wat they liked to each other
But Pauline came out at once
Andrea heard her go racing
upstairs then the rapid opening
and shutting of a drawer and her
footsteps coming down again
Perhaps never she thought
when at last she was in
her own room staring at
her white face in the mirror
Perhaps she had given herself
away too blatantly and he
would keep clear of e her
It sounded as though
she might never again
be alone with Mark Why
offer herself again and
again for punishment
The door opened and
Gus came back Leaving
him to get acquainted
he explained
Does Dr Horgan have to know 
 He ll have to know I suppose It ll

You can put it in your pipe and
smoke it So long as Rose was
alive Hilary couldnt have
mortgaged everything he owned
without her consent
The excitement ebbed She said
with the quiet of despair Peter
moved resolutely off with the tray
Mary picked up a cigarette and
lighted it without speaking Lisabelle
glanced appealing down at her
He had not only taken a great
deal of trouble on her behalf but had
foreseen exactly the kind of food that
would appeal to her But charm and good
looks and attentiveness in small ways were
qualities essential to the fortune hunter
That s what you think The glint
in Dora Mays cold blue eyes
was a signpost the least
discering could follow I m
Positive Mary said firmly that
twentyfive thousand dollars doesnt
mean any more to Hilary than
twentyfive cents would to me
I dont need to know much
about Hilarys affairs to know
he s one of the richest men in
the State Mary said Dora
May rose to the bait Hilarys
Lawyers secretary is a close
personal friend of mine
If Rose had that will after
we had words I wouldnt
have blamed her But she didnt
She made it while everything was
fine between us So Dora May had
quarrelled with Rose
It was possible that the
notary might have come out the
afternoon of the funeral Lisabelle
And Peter and she had been riding
and away from the house for hours
I know all about the man in Dallas
And the good doctor tells her
everything Well no He has one of
h dictaphone things so she can keep
a record of what his patients say I guess he

PleShe was the only friend I had at
the ranch She knew what it was
to be another  m Sure Rose knew
that Hilary was going bankrupt 
she said with another startling
shift of mood
They dont look very exciting though
Mary sat down in the desk chair her back
turned to Dora Mays gaze while she
opened the letters They were not as she
d judged very exciting
Now that Rose was dead
the picture had changed
substantially There would be
no one to share the vast
fortune with Lisabelle She
would be the sole beneficiary
in the normal course of events
which would make her a very 
rich young woman indeed
The chances were she
wouldnt get the telephone call untill
tomorrow at the earliest Mary
thought But there was a dynamic
quality about James Danford that made
anything possible At 10 oclock Mary
reluctantly rose from the canvas chair
outside her door
Mary put all her letters into her
purse rose without haste and moved
towards the fireplace Despite the warmth
outside it was cool in here and the fire
was welcome She tossed the envelopes
onto the blaze stood watching them a
moment
Dora May was gratified
You know as well as I do
Rose didnt kill herself Why
did you go to Dr Summersbys
Office and ask him about
those painkillers of Hilarys
if you didnt suspicion
something
Goodness gracious no
And dont you dare put words
into my mouth You claim
Rose would never have consented
to Hilarys borrowing the money
he needed You say that if Rose
would have consented she might
be alive today
There is nothing for me
to do but loaf and wait for
a long distance call about
some materials i need
So if I could be of any help
Nor could any power on
earth stop her from talking
Mary realized that the part of
wisdom was to accept the situation
without further protest and if possible
extract some benefit from it
When he spoke it was with an
eloquent  farfromoldworld wow
Lisabelles Cheeks were almost
the colour of the watermelon pink
silk as she presented herself for
Marys inspection
Sparking each word
with bitter contempt she accused
him with shaking vehemence
You pose as something you never
were Trying to win your way into
Mister Carlyles confidence  was right
just to spy on him for your
Yankee masters
The boy tried to make the agechanging
voice sound hard and it might have
sounded ludicrous had it not been for the
reckless chill shimmering in catyellow eyes
Want to see him Brock said
The troopers had been joshing with
a starryeyed Tomas They snapped
to rigid silence as the Major
approached and mounted his roan gelding
The boy ran to the gate scraped
it open and waved the trotting detail
on its way
Go climb your horse Dont know
what you re talking about I ll
bet you dont Very well sureshot
You re a big boy now Should be
able to look after yourself without
Got patrols cutting the country
Our friend Carlyle should be grateful
since his wagons will soon be back
with supplies Might be he ll need
a little cavalry protection You re
taking those dispatches seriously 
I must see you Mister Taylor
she whispered leaning close Just
for a minute Please Brock glanced
impatiently inside the saloon Yes
maam
Sorry you feel that way maam
But I dont see what that has to
do with calling me a spy
 Please dont try to brazen it
out Mister Taylor  if that is
your name
The large eyes lit up
I can do that I can
promise  like a soldier
You can I do it Mister
Brock I promise like a
soldier
Then stay off
But not Juanito He is
a good mule Sometimes
I ride him almost as far
as where the Sheriff
lived Hold on now
A soldier has to walk
too
Dont see im do yuh
Brock looked the boy over
from shabby boots to
oversized hat What
are you trying to do
sonny Play like you re
a man
A soldier must learn to
take orders do as he is told
Your mother is your commander 
like the Major See
When she feel you not
to go to the mine that
is an order
Call it what you will There s a
nastier term for it Mister Carlyle
told me Oh he did did he Jamming
the hat on his head Brock leaped to
Rustys back swung him towards the
mine
I ll keep an eye on Parkhurst  Slocum
if that s what he wants to be called 
while I look into other things Well 
Carlyle for one
Now look feller It s none of
your business I m making it
my business His eyes sparked
with understanding Ahhhh
I see I see
You know better n to bring a horse
that close to Jet Mister Carlyle
Sure give it to yuh he finds out
From the saddle Brock said You
just tell me where Caryle is and
I ll see that he finds out
Could it have been the
black dress of mourning
that brought out such
warm lights last evening
Just thought I d say hello
he repeated awkwardly
See if there s anything I can
do to 
You mean you gonna tell Mister
Carlyle Dismounting Brock slip
knotted the reins around the end
post of the hitch rail Keep that
black devil away from Rusty or
you ll have a sick horse on your
hands he warned and leaped to the
wooden sidewalk
Maybe Stevens niece
could furnish a clue he
told himself as the proud
chestnut stretched limber
legs across the rocky soil
His interest was purely in the
shooting Nothing else
Dont be i a hurry Enjoy
what you have around here
while you can Oh I do
Mister Brock I do a lot of
things here that I like
A tough decision to make
Half the fun of being a boy was
in doing the things you were
forbidden to do On the other
hand to be a soldier 
See him before he growled The
boy shook his head I shoulda give
it to him Gimpy glared at the boy
Listen kid
She stood framed in
the doorway a formal fulllength
portrait with hands clasped
before her head high Just
what do you want here
Mister Taylor Why 
Sometimes he went away quickly
sometimes he sat for quarter an hour
saying little He wanted badly to
tell him how sorry he was for the
hard offhand way he had sometimes
behaved to him
As soon as there s anything
fresh  A nurse came three
times a day and sat his
father up to feed him Most
of the time he lay on his
back with his eyes open
She took a deep breath and
gave her thick neck and
shoulders a shake which she
probably thought a convulsive
shudder She found no diffi
culty in assuming for convenience
that the attack she had begun
on Martin hadnt happened
He needed some warning
of what he would find He
could imagine his mother
saying later If only I had
had the sense to tell you
not to disturb him that
first evening
His father gave no sign that
he had noticed Perhaps it had
been a lump of the pillow He
went quickly to the door When
he came on to the landing he
heard his mother telephoning in
the hall below
Did you capture it His father
shook his head smiling a little at
something the question had made him
remember Did you find it
He shook his head again
She usually went upstairs
heavily lifting her knees sideways
as if her feet were weighted frowning
at the effort Or perhaps she
might never understand that they
were worse than going upstairs
She said This is the time we
should have someone we could
trust He went round the deal
table on the far side from her down
the passage and upstairs
It was so unlike him that he
could not understand it He knew now
that he had expected his father
to accept this with the same
smile that he accepted every
thing else He wanted to say
something to prove it wasnt
true
There was a low light on a chest
of drawers The two beds were at
the far ends with their feet towards
him one flat the blankets on the other
raised in a narrow heap
Later he could remember
the vicious things his
mother had said about
Mr Bowers He had not questioned
that he must believe that he
had always been wicked His
father had not said these
 things but he had not
contradicted them
Things had not been settled
in the poor way they later
became settled He remembered
a time when they had gone
to stay with the Bowerses
and Bowers had been building
a mud wall some rustic craft
he had discovered
 That  s what I said Mrs 
Mason  After she had said 
a lot more he said  No 
Mrs Mason that was not what 
I said  
She had often complained about 
his father  s choice of doctor and 
knew now that she had been right 
He understood why his father had chosen 
him On the upper landing he stood in 
front of his father  s door not sure whether 
to knock 
How serious Oh he wouldnt
tell me that You cant
remember anything he said 
 I tell you I can remember
very well indeed  
He decided that the hotel had
won the round and he got up and
moved over to the lifts Then
Sam realised that Mary was dead
He saw the the penknife His
penknife
We must eat up all our bread and
butter before we have any cake
mustnt we Then Sam tensed
Perhaps this imbecile was the
murderer who d come back to
gloat and perhaps to do some
more damage
Jesus  If Marys body was found in Sams
room with Sams knife pinning it down
to the dimension of eternity  Although
Sam wanted to concentrate on getting the body
out of the room he couldnt control this
thoughts
But surely he was doing more than that
For Sam ought to be prejudiced Sam was
as black as night My name s trash she d
said but we ll give you a nice one so that
you can be proud of yourself
Then Sam saw that
the footsteps belonged to the
man with a straggly beard the
one who had claimed Hans attention
at the party Suddenly Sam felt
reckless He wasnt going to wait
for danger written in the stars
He looked for another bell in case the
one he had been ringing was at fault
When he found it he  jabbed
it with a viciousness that surprised him
He might have saved his finger but
obstinacy made him sit himself down in
a padded chair
Sam felt his eyes swelling like
bubbles Will you say that again he
demanded faintly Perhaps Mr Dark
Chand said brusquely you are finding
it hard to believe in me
What a coincidence
for it seems Sam pointed
out that I have caught up
with you But he other was
recovering his composure
I was waiting he explained
till we passed a bar
Sam lifted the telephone
and to his amazement it was
answerred almost immediately
Anyone would think the hotel was
running to orderly schedule Sam
said Give me police headquarters
But the man had not even
troubled to ask Sam
whether he belived in capital
punishment whether he
thought that vengeance
was a dish best eaten cold
Of course it was not right
that the black men who
killed whites sould always
be punished
It looked real And
now said the hotel
detective I will have
to ask you to accompany
me Sam stepped back
I dont want to be locked
in the kitchen and told I ve
got to wash dishes for the
rest of my life
Dear me Mr Dark I would
have thought that any further
violence was quite unnecessary 
Sam spun round Sam
goggled at him Where the devil
have you been he said
bitterly
We ve had trouble with an
old lady who lost a valuable
brooch I ve been interviewing
all the staff The old lady insisted on
it Of course in the end we discovered
that she d used the brooch for pinning
a cheque to her laundry list
He put the mirror over
Mary Parkers mouth Mary
was dead all right There
wasnt much blood but
Sam knew that if he
pulled out the knife there d
be plenty
Foster had always been hitting his
native servants but with the gardener
he had gone too far It s only right that
Foster should hang Singh said curtly
Yet this new Government may not
like to start what they call a
new era with the execution of
a white man
My name is Singh but I wanted to
talk to you about Foster
Why should you want to talk
to me about Foster It
happened before I came to this
country
Miss Graham had been in his care
She had been in a highly nervous
State A verdict of suicide while the
balance of her mind was disturbed was
returned Philip put down the
evening newspaper looked at Gordon Neal
and said
How honourable was that That was im
possible He had been honest with her
and didnt deserve to be let down
She said suddenly irrelevantly
Beryls Life recently  the whole
thing  was very strange when you
think of it
Sandra gave a pained
cry Darling I hinted
that too you remember
I didnt want to sound too
dramatic or  well  I know 
Philip smiled smugly 
 They are made I  ve A special 
license licence and notifi 
cation has been given to the 
vicar  Brandon  s Good 
Gordon said curtly  It is 
usual for the bride  s parents 
to have some hand in all this 
you know Philip  
He worked in bed using a portable
typewriter and was completely
absorbed in his task Sandra was there 
to attend to all his needs His World was
whole again and he to himself its hub
Philip felt that he was running a 
high temperature as fear swirled back 
What had Nicholas said  I would never 
have done so while Beryl was alive 
He hads it any answer  exept to 
suggest that if I believed him 
ca able  at   
Everything  s ready She looked 
around her Part of her life 
was ending a part she had loved 
Leaving the flat and staying at 
Monk  s Toft would be an ordeal 
despite the rest from perpetual work 
 Are you trying to suggest that 
I was her lover Responsible for   
He stopped Conflict tortured him 
He shivered Taking with her the 
only proof he had to discount this 
accusation 
Sandra realized with a bitter 
futility that now it was her 
silence that was the lie And 
Nicholas  s word reechoed 
mockingly  No human being 
could live with absolute 
truth   I  couldn  t live 
without faith Philip 
The last person he would 
want told was you   It 
added up and Sandra nodded  
But it is still like looking at a 
picture in shadow   I told you 
that  soon after the cottage 
episode 
He spoke with greater passion
Was this why you wanted to leave
the job just before Philip was
taken ill His mouth hardened
his eyes became steely I see
No to be fair What Philip felt
that he had been swirled down a bumpy lift
But why He hastened Why should
she call
He loved Sandra too deeply to
ruin her future happiness
Philips Spirits soared He was
better he had made a
miraculous recovery and Sandra
would soon be his wife The
devil he thought certainly
looked after his own
The thought of Nicholas
haunted her the sense of loss
crucifying Her fathers com
ment roused her as he said
I was not talking of a carnival
But I presume we shall be
allowed to have one or two of
our friends at the ceremony
Even in that his hands were tied 
He dare not precipitate what might well be 
another coronary And in that second he put 
back his professional mantle and said with 
such icy politeness such withdrawn bitterness 
that Sandra withered before it 
Fear would be a deterrent
Sandra flung her arms out in
a gesture of despair
Do you leave me anything
else to believe Or is
your silence the cowardly
way out
He wouldnt marry her and he
dare not risk the threat of the
child Obviously it would have been
a handicap to her too and in
her saner moments she must have
been thankful to get out of the
mess 
There was enough evidence no
matter how one might want to
disbelieve the facts Elation
touched him after the cold wind
of suspense It will be interesting
to see what comes out at the inquest
Then with a gesture she
knew so well he tore off
the leaflet and handed it to her
Goodbye Sandra he said
with a deadly finality
Watching him go unable to speak
I love you  oh you know
that well enough Love
She revolted against the
word Nicholas Philip 
Where was happiness or
peace of mind
You can take it from
me that he can and does
But even if he were impotent
I d still love and want him
There are sides to me you ll
never know
To copulate is natural to
mak love s an art And
I m no artist On the
contrary I ll roll up at the
Polytechnic Liszt And
Tchaikovsky were born
geniusis but they had
to learn how to read
and write notes
He often used to try to
imagine her reactions if he
had once treated her as he
did Charlie but his
imagination failed The efficient
little Mary would probably
have called it a shocking
waste of time and told
him to get down to
business
No truthful You re the faithful type
And that s a lot considering that 60 per
cent of all married women in the
West never get full satisfaction They
dont dare tell a loving husband they
only begin to like it when he s already
had his fun and prepares for sleep
Hers was flushed and lo
vely OK Teacher Was that
any better You know it was He
sat down and ran his finger down
along her spine Do you love me now
I d make you miserable I
mean that I d Very probably
be unfaithful and that d kill
you Then I d be unfaithful
too to teach you a lesson
He fell morosely on the bed
She came over and sat down
beside him How old are you
Twentyfour  and fully grown as
others can tell you Well I m
twentyseven
Correct ducky Your just wait till
you meet the girl who thinks you re
a god It ll make you feel like
one You think that sculptor s
a god
Boy are you kidding You mean
you dont want me any more
Dont tell me you re willing to sacrifice
yourself again For answer she
pushed him back against the
cushions and brought her face very
close
At last Derek got tired
and left If he d stayed any
longer I d jolly well have
asked him to join us I m so
darned cold I could do with
two men
He d thrown his pride to the wind
and accepted Charlies superiority
in seduction And it was hard to
imagine a prettier teacher To have
her twist in an attempt to receive
a caress he was purposely withholding
to hear her deepthroated moan of
full satisfaction and feel her
shivering clawing surrender
Her voice came soft and sweet as
a marshmallow And Desire came up
with a straight left and Anger staggered
 Her voice was a great gentle
murmur caressing him with words that
were as sweet as they were naughty and 
nonsensical
Instead he said Will that be
better She nodded And she
might add And dont forget to
leave the lights on You lose half
the fun when you fumble in the dark
Desire uppercutted neatly and Anger
took the full count He looked up into her
eyes and saw the immeasurable depth
of eternity that God has put in there for
man to lose himself in
IN 1913 Dr  Burge  Bishop of Southwark
asked me to go as Vicar of St  Marks 
Woodcote  Purley  a new church built by the
wellknown architect Mr  George Fellowes Prynne 
who was to become a very intimate friend 
and I was later on joint executor of his state
his
The Hall proved most usefull
especially in winter when the
distance to the church deterred
many from coming to Sunday
evensong There was a somewhat
shocked atmosphere in some quarters
until I explained that my church was
800 feet high
But what a change from
the dear little old church at
Tatsfield to the great modern
church of St  Mark  s at
Purley  One felt at Tatsfield
that  small as the church was 
it had its own atmosphere  and
for centuries had been a House
of Prayer  I could not but feel
the
Each child had a
picture given them and the
lesson was largely based on
this Mr And Mrs Charlton have
been from the first difficult years
of war when most lives were
upset and some tempers were
easily frayed the most loyal
and devoted friends
We had a splendid body of
local residents and a series of
excellent honorary Secretaries
Our Committee met once a week in
the evenings and included proffessional
men from every walk of life
We also had a little
Mission Hall leading off the
Brighton Road  in a street full
of small houses  This was
called Ellen Avenue when
I first went there  but was
soon changed into the better
sounding name of Lansdowne
Road  There 
So at 3 pm the car drove up
to the Hall and out of it stepped
our Bishop with the Archbishop of
Canterbury Dr Davidson said he
would go for a walk over the
fields while we attended to our
business
This opened up a new interest
and we plunged into it This
was the village doctor who was
an old friend at Clifton He
could sustain the tenor part
quite well and lead the
others to school
Then we went to work on Cole
ridge Taylors Hiawathas wedding
feast 5 St Marks Woadcote 1913
1922 Dr Burge was not able to be pre
sent at the institution and induction
Service in St Marks
A great blow disturbed
all our efforts in the following
year 1914 when war broke
out Very soon Chaplains
for the forces were urgently
needed and I felt clearly
that one of us must volunteer
When we had found a group
of people who gladly
cooperated we made the little
side chapel a place of day
prayer In time we received similar
gifts for the high Altar and
large East and West windows
The Church Army Captain had done very good work
in the Lansdowne Road district but I needed more help
in the church for the full rota of services on Sundays and
weekdays Most fortunately I was able to engage the
Rev E U Evitt in 1913 soon after I had
come and he organized the Mission
The innovation at the 1961 
Census though the family 
Census had previously in 
cluded the question was the 
date of termination of the 
first or only marriage  In 
Wales and Monmouthshire the 
question on the ability to 
speak Welsh was included as 
previously 
Some 69000 enumerators were
appointed in England and Wales
Applications for appointment were
received in great numbers in
nearly all urban areas but
in some rural areas there was
difficulty in making up the numbers
required
They also compile an enumeration record 
of their district with the provisional 
count of numbers and a list of all 
buildings residential premises and 
households There is far more in the 
job than mere issue and collection 
of forms 
Nine out of ten private
householders received a form
with fewer questions than
previously this century The tenth
received a form not much larger
in content than the 1951
questionnaire Orderincouncil 
In 1961 the enumerators
were asked to note whether the
building was wholly or partly
residential  and whether it
contained one or more dwellings 
In 1951 questions had been
declined includes

The information collected

But above all the work

for the recruitment of enumerators
were sent out in early January
Abby  s Puttyblob of a nose has 
turned red For a moment Lea had 
feared a scene then Abby has 
laughed had turned the talk to 
something else Lea was not sure 
of Mort Paladrey 
 But you  ll be all right now  
Will I Lea wondered I doubt 
it Unconsciously her gaze went 
to the other door Everything 
now seemed silent beyond it 
She answered  No That is 
Babby is of course and Honor 
And Eddie was  Her plump bosom 
went up and down just like 
a billowing wave before she 
went on explaining 
Mrs Steward Too That s our
dayly Rita Stewart She s a
widow She hesitated as though
expecting t at Lea would
break her silence Clack clack
clackety clack
Abby seemed to answer without thought too
She said Oh he hates it and us Chapter four
Lea woke to the certain knowledge that something
unpleasant was to be faced
She was suddenly silent Lea
saw with surprise that the rosebudy
mouth was no longer a bud It was
thin and straight and tight Then
abruptly it relaxed The bright
little eyes looked into hers and the
clacketyclack continued as
though the break had never been
Someone had brought her up and
gone straight away again to the
room next door Where the baby
was She d heard voices in there
for a long time Even now if she
went close to the communicating door
she could hear faint voices the
other side
Like I do Lea thought
and glanced accross at
the communicating door
The baby was still asleep
Standing there she told
herself she had much
to be glad for She had
warmth and shelter and
food and comfort
She wished that she d started to tidy up
and hadnt been found like this  a mess
She knew that was how she appeared 
She d seen herself in the mirror
coming up the stairs and she d looked
terrible
People used him as they liked 
and he never seemed to get more 
than a penny or two out of it I 
kept house for him and things 
were just perfect Mrs Beverly 
That was what the figure
looked like Hastily Lea
groped for her glasses again
and the ghost became a
plump greyhaired woman in
a grey pleated skirt and
grey jumper One of the people
who d been downstairs in
the hall
She made a lot of jokes
about it being an ancient
monument she d restored for
England Well Mort fell for her
and that was that She made
a little gesture of her plump
hands and the pouter bosom
billowed again
The old gentleman was dying
then and we see Babba made him
an offer he said yes  An offer Lea
was beginning to feel dizzy For the
place
She was acting selfishly
denying the baby a name 
but perhaps she was giving
him more than a name
He had security comfort
for a little at least
Lulling her Then
there was the big
wave of surprise and
she jerked Wales I
thought you were Ameri
cans Miss Paladrey looked
equally surprised Her rose
bud mouth went into a
perfect crumpled O
I seem to have talked enough but
I wanted to put you straight about
everyone in the house Lea thought
warmly so I wasnt invisible to one
person anyway She felt swift
gratitude towards the plump chattering
woman
Sweet dreams They ll be sweet all
right I shall be dreaming of you
He drew back the curtains and let
the sea breeze in before he got into bed
That phase of my life
is over  And the future
Rob what do you look for
in the future  Whatever
comes he said lightly
Tomorrow night will be
exhausting I shall never be
able to face it He jumped up
I had forgotten all about
tomorrow How selfish of me It
doesnt seem quite real somehow
after this 
In fact I wish we were I dont
want to go back If you are going to
stay then I shall stay with you He
turned towards her
Now that we are in my
country will you allow me to
choose for you a really French
meal Of course As she gave
the order to the waiter using
her hands so expressively if was
difficult for Rob to imagine
why she had singled him out
Still game for a swim he
asked I ll fetch my things and be
with you in five minutes For half
an hour they splashed about in
the water more clear and blue
than Rob had believed possible
He had been particularly
looking forward to this
breakfast in the cool of
the morning on the broad
terrace looking straight
out to sea There would
have been something
particularly intimate
about it
The expression in her eyes
was hidden from the lamplight
He looked at her for a long time
Then he said slowly Yes I believe
that She sat back smiling
triumphantly
Abruptly he said I ll pay
the bill and we ll wald
down to the sea I want
to see if it s as clear as
they say it is They took off
their shoes and the sand
was soft and smooth
beneath their feet
Gaby said impishly Let s
paddle No one can see us from
there Rob tucked up his trousers
and she kicked her nylons
towards the high white sandals
They waded into the shallow water
She met his gaze You
are looking at me again Rob
I was just thinking how lovely
you are You make me say all the
things I never thought I could
say aloud
He had believed it then and
in an odd sort of way it was still
true The man who first said there
were many faces of love was right
He went on slowly
It was a cosmopolitan gathering of stars
There were English American French Italian
and a couple from Brazil Rob began by
feeling overawed before realizing that
most of them had probably come up
the same way as he had
When at last he released her
he was still feeling dizzy from
the impact Gaby started to rub at
her feet with a wisp of a
handkerchief But everything about
her was petite
No of course not She was
silent while the first course of
steaming artichokes soaked in
a buttery sauce was served
Then her smile dazzled him
I hope you have a good
appetite tonight Rob
He smiled into the darkness Yes
I would Of course I would
that s the glorious part of it Oh Gaby
He turned and kissed her again
running his hand through her hair
Afraid Yes I couldnt have
stood that I think I felt this way
about you the moment I saw you at
the Savoy party Then you do love me 
she said slowly
I ll try to remember Shall we go 
ow He reached for her hand
She looked this morning as though
she had stepped straight out of
the sunshine She wore a full
white skirt of some silky material
and a yellow top
For the moment every
thing had been said They
were content merely to be
together Outside Gabys room he
said I wonder what time band call
will be I ve heard in the morning
but I m not sure
We have our careers to think
of first of all A romance can do no
harm to our publicity at the moment
but marriage must wait Dont you agree
We both will I know that she said
vehemently Before we are finished
everyone in Paris Rome and New York
will have heard all about Rob Martin
the famous British singer 
True he would have  no truck
with bishops or a prayer Book
I meddel not with any mans conscience he said
And Irishmen  were of course another
matter altogether
But there is so much also
which one welcomes much
not least the 1662 prayer Book
born under such strange portents
We no longer look starryeyed and
refer to this incomparable Book
Before Christmas 1660 five
editions of the 1604 Book had been
printed But most people regarded these reprints
of the 1604 Book as a stopgap A revision was
clearly called for and the object of that
revision was clearly expressed by nine
bishops who were still alive
These were also the
days when Lancelot
Andrewes was writing
his preces privatae as
well as being a great
bishop The days too
of George Herbert many
of whose poems have
become muchloved hyms
It could hardly be more definite
In that year Shakespeare had just
turned forty and had written Hamlet
two years before Bacon was at
work and Milton was just
learning to read
The Bishop of London presided As far as
the bishops were concerned it was obvious
and natural that the Churchs prayer Book
should be restored The onus of argument
was therefore placed on the Puritans who had
plenty to say
Forever associated with Charles is
Archbishop Laud now so much
nobler a figure than former
historians led us to believe Laud
was enthusiastically hated by
Calvinists and Puritans and the
sentiment was mutual
What s more people wanted
Gods blessing on their weddings
But only one civil marriages were
allowed The twenty years of
the Commonwealth proved a
negative inhibiting experience
The Puritans were obsessed with
their own theological gloom
and snuffed any tiny candle of
pleasure which came within
their reach
The new century opened with
James 1 ascending the throne 
He was quite prepared to be
tolerant towards Rome though
the Gunpowder Plot spoiled
that  The Puritans had high
hopes  for James had grown up
in Presbyterian Scotland 
English Churches suffered yet
another despoliation And
Evelyn the diarist could record
Another sad day The church
now in caves and dens of the earth
Finally in 1649 Charles was beheaded
and a thrill of horror ran through
the country
Laud was called upon to do
severe things Or when he found
cockfighting going on in church
Laud made a positive approach
He set out to increase a sense of
reverence
The doctrine of the divine
right of kings made the bulls
eyes of these targets almost
indistinguishable And no king
no bishop was the obvious
implication Charles went even
further and asserted a king
could do no wrong
Christianity is for the fullness
of man not for his suppression
How much greater the pity then
that Chor 2 could not prove
more worthy on taking up
the crown
The new century opened with
James 1 ascending the throne
He was quite prepared to be
tolerant towards Rome though
the gunpowder plot spoiled
that The Puritans had high
hopes for James had grown up

hopes were dashed
They objected to the word

he remarked on it
and spoke of having seen her
gift to the gallery Oh do please
sit down She raised her voice then
and called out
I think it gave him the feeling
of being in his Office  and more
at home  Then wont you come
and see it all  Sometime perhaps
The girl s only a kid when all s
said and done and from upcountry
too You d think he d know his
onions a bit more wouldnt you
than to carry on like that
Naturally Mr Longdon Wasnt that a rather
superfluous question But she smild smild
He took his leave of her then and they
shook hands Hers was thin and bony and very
narrow across the knuckles
There was always her
chauffeur with her and
sometimes her maid She
looked too dam 
 with her head
held high  and in her spiked
heels she was taller than
himself
He couldnt think of anything and so he
said nothing She works in the hairdressing
at Longdons and he got her the job
He picked her up somewhere That
sounds very kind of him 
Once no Toorak woman
would have been seen dead downtown
without a hat on He wanted to say
to her Dont spread that story
Thornie But he wasnt her keeper
neither was he the guardian of the
reputation
I ve taken you she said
at your word Although I
think the suggestion was that
I should the telephone you
first But if you are not alone
and I have come at an incon
venient hour I will go away
again
No like it is very kind
of you to have asked
me And then when he
would have rung off she
said I suppose you have
changed the flat a lot
While they were waiting
for it she said Have you
met your neighbour yet
For a moment he had thought
it was but that woman
was less tall and also younger
I Suddenly felt lonely My maid
is out She laught I found I
was out of cigarettes too
Perhaps I smoke too much
It was the opening for a little
discussion on the minor vices as
two shipboard companions might talk
while occupying long chairs side by
side
Will you pour your own please and
one for me James did so and when
he had put the glass into her hand
she said Will you please bring up the
little table
I m Here she said and
I ve got my key She was
carrying a big black
crocodile bag and she
had a parcel as well
He looked at his watch he
would be late for lunch
downtown but perhaps his
guests could cool their heels for
a little while The maid appeared
and took the parcel from her
mistress who said
None of these classes

None of these classes except
the yeomen paid or expected
to pay direct taxes During the
fourteenth century the traditional
methods of financing the Exchequer
had become stabilized In addition to
these revenues the King had the financial
benefits of his position at the head of the
feudal system as its chief landowner and
the recipient of the fines of Royal justice
The method of assessment
to which the Commons agreed
was that of the first polltax
He only agreed to lend them for a
short time for Scarburghs
use in his lectures and ultimately
presented them to Royal society
BUT NONE OF THESE
DEDUCTIONS WERE DRAWN AT
THE TIME  BECAUSE LARGE
SCALE WAR REQUIRED MONEY 
AND THE CITIZENS WHO HAD
THE MONEY WERE NOT YET
SUFFICIENTLY AT
Two years later the inventors
of the first polltax tried again
The anger of the Commons was
only appeased by the voluntary production
of accounts which prooved the
desperate need for funds
It was naturally a
highly popular victory

Once again she checked back her

she did not fail to appreciate
the faith which he was placing
in her and was prepared to
accept the responsibility
Even the snowcapped
summit of Mont Blanc
seven miles below was not
 recognisable
among the host of lower
peaks The screen of the
airtoair radar glowed The
sky seemed to be deserted
Suddenly the nature of the silence changed
During the fiftyodd minutes since they had left
Bond Boscombe Bown Geoffrey had become
So accustomed to the unbroken note of the great
engines that they were no longer audible
Alastair came in very fast but
within less than half a mile the
machine rolled to a halt He cut the
engines and flung open the canopy
Darkness had descended like a curtain
by the time they docked at Belleray
He had used one of them himself
to dispose of Stefano and Pietro He
determined to act on the assumption
that Eve was alive He tried to imagine
what the Italians would do next
Geoffrey had had no contact
with her but Alastair seemed to
have developed a tremendous
admiration for her intelligence During
the earlier part of their flight from
Boscombe Down he had repeated the gist
of his third conversation with her
The directional angle of the
scanner could be adjusted to cover
any particular area within its range
Geoffrey turned the scale slowly to
cover the ground immediately ahead
He was able to pick out towns
unrecognisable to the naked eye
obscured by the ground haze which
even on the clearest night limited
angular vision

landmark in physics was

Rutherford international jubilee
conference early in September
The exact State of oxidation
of the deposited film is unknown
and a further effect of oxidation
can be observed upon baking in air
Heat treatment and protection A further
heating period in air for 30 min at
300 deg C completes the annealing
of the film
These are two of the few glasses
unaffected by water vapour Sodalime
glasses are not used because their
surface are also chemically unstable
Some further reaction with the deposited
film must be expected
A radiant heater dissipating 750 w
at 110 v was mounted above the
workholder to raise the temperature
of the substrate to 300 deg C before
evaporation The temperature of the
substrate was measured by means
of a chromelalumel thermocouple
placed inside the vacuum chamber
with its junction resting on
the top face of the
workholder
A simple ohmmeter was
used for monitoring the resistance
value during evaporation The
accuracy of the measurements was
only of the order 14 2  but the
results were used only to indicate
the approximate value of the resistance
during evaporation
3 Experimental work Evaporation
technique The evaporation source
was heated by electron bombardment
Fig 1 Nickelchromium wire 22 swg
was fed through a stainless guide tube to
the centre of the hearth
The number of nuclei is dependent
upon the physik and
chemical properties of the
metal and substrate and upon
the rate of deposition As
the nuclei increase in size
they grow together eventually
to form a continuous film
Evaporation conditions During deposition
the substrate his heated to relieve the
internal stress in the film but this
treatment can also increase the rate of
oxidation The fall in pressure can readily be
observed on the vacuum gauge
2 Practical requirements Substrate
Any variation of surface smoothness gives
a corresponding variation of film resistance value
because the film is thin enough to be greatly
affected by the State of the surface

Worship In its classic days there was
enough of the Anabaptist and
enough of the quaker in most
congregationalists to ensure that any
kind of fixed liturgy would be entirely
unwelcome
But along with it are many
buildings whose social
significance is unmistakable
One thing however all modern
sanctuaries have in common
The restful effect of bare space
especially at the front of the
church has now been recognized
and admitted
11 Worship and praise Architecture
Within the pulpit and table are
usually in the centre of the longer
side of the rectangle and nobody
sits far from the minister
There are many records of this
custom but one example must suffice
It concerns the death of the Duchess of
Burgundy wife of the Dauphin of France in 1712
and is taken by Havard from the Journal de
Dangeau

In this new context the ceremonial bed or
lite the parade became an acceptet part
of social life in Western Europe from
early renaissance times until the  French
revolution
This is particularly prevalent among
elderly people but can be alleviated by
the application of ointments on a medical
prescription The irritants associated with
dust under beds may sometimes be so
powerful that the beds occupant may
seem to be afflictes by a chronic
cold
The lit de parade also
provided women with an
excuse to indulge the extra
vagance so characteristic of
their sex Unchivalrously the
husbands who had to provide
such innocent indulgences
eventually began to count the
cost

she had left her sunglasses on

her luggage had disappeared and
they were alone together
Gavin joined her and
at once dispelled her fears

This was a slight shock to 
Vittoria who had forgotten the 
existence of the girle and up 
to this moment had been unaware 
of the young man  s presence at the 
palazzo 
The young man with her 
is Orlando Cavalcanti 
Francesco  s friend  Orsini shot an 
impatient glance at the couple  
The young man with the mole  
 Yes indeed  
Surely she could not
have overheard anything they
said A moments reflection
reassured her on that point
for she was certain no one
had been standing near them
Santa Maria
Glancing at Lucia he
said in French to Vittoria
Your maid  is she reliable
She shrugged her shoulders
and replied in the same language
Yes But make it worth her while
Lucia uttered a cry of
alarm Look madonna we
are surrounded It was 
true Men armed with pikes
and daggers swarmed about
them and a lean swarthy
fellow was peering through
the window grinning impudently
Her thoughts at this moment
were chaotic The coach now
turned in another direction towards
the wild and desolate region behind
the baths It was sparsely inhabited
dotted with fallow fields and
terraced vineyards and here and
there jutted a brown outcrop of
flowerwreathed ruins
What she had forgotten in her 
selfabsorption in her own schemes was 
that other people were equally absorbed in 
their schemes which were likely to run counter 
to her own This move today was a reminder 
of that fact 
Every instinct urged her to surrender 
for there was that in his nature to 
which her own had responded as it had 
responded to no other human being 
Prudence ambition and reason had 
held instinct in check and they must 
dictate her course 
Lucia was regarding him as a
rabbit looks at a stoat
Thrusting his head farther into
the coach he said sombrely
Have you ever heard of a
punishment called the cord

about her breathing the

fiercely You would be the last man

collect his wits to reply to this
there was a bustle and confusion
at the end of the room
Francesco She despised for
his dullness his lack of
initiative his subservience
to his uncle Her husbands
gentleness and amiability
his unselfish love for her
she regarded as signs of
weakness
Before replying to this she glanced hastily
around then spoke in tones so low that he had
to bend his head to hear I will never be any
mans mistress
Be pleased to alight  I think  she 
replied coolly  I prefer to stay where I 
am   In that case  he reverted to 
French  I shall be obliges to lift you

The thought of the covenant
relationsship seems to be completely
absent from the wording of the
revised catechism 5 6 So has
the demand that W who come to the
Lords supper should first examine
themselves
We ask again can it be held
that the knowledge of these
five ministries of grace is in any
way essential to salvation Can any
warrant and sanction for them be found
in existing Anglican formularies or in
the main stream of the Anglical
theological tradition
The reference to the world
the flesh and the devil in the
first baptismal vow has been
replaced by a weak general
reference to wrong and evil
We gather however that the devil
at least is soon to be restored
And furthermore it is essential
for the catechumen to be in
structed in the precise functions of
bishops priests and deacons in the
Church of England setup before he
be admitted to the Lords table
The answer is no in both
cases Certainly not This is Roman
doctrine not the doctrine of
the Church of England 3
In the first place it has no clear
meaning which fact alone makes
it unfit to stand in a catechism
4 At this point however
we would make a more
radical criticism But
the assumption that these
five types of ministerial
action each convey a special
grace ex opere operato is without
warrant in Anglican theology

mumbled my mouth dry
How else She seemed to relax
a little but only a little
And the girl
The doors were shut
Slowly I opened them a fraction
looked in It showed signs of recent
occupation Papers scattered
over the floor Cigaretteends too A
couple of what seemed to be pinup
pictures stuck to one wall
They held nothing I looked
around for the jacket There
was no sign of it It hung by
the side of the chair partly
concealed from me I picked it up
drew out the automatic
You know of Farrel Ask for him
Go to him or De Sotto Her face turned
I looked into her eyes And you I will
follow  I said hastily
I picked up the shirt The
right sleeve of Bakers rain
coat which had been torn ripped
open
It was heavily bloodstained
I went cold It had been that
same sleeve
Do as you re told My voice
was harsh impatient No We
go together There wasnt time
to argue On to the landing then
padding softly making for the far end
Then I went over to the lamp bent
to blow it out From behind me in the
doorway I heard the slither of footsteps
I had forgotten Seona Standing in the
doorway her nose wrinkled in disgust at the
smell in the room was the woman Jeronimo
had called Elsa
Shoot him Get him out of
the way Nervously she licked
her lips Yes she said and
her voice was uncertain And
inside me my nerves seemed
to shiver to jar
My nerves were
jangling It creaked My heart
missed a beat I waited
Still no sound from
outside I opened the door
wide Carefully I looked out
into the passageway
The boy had closed in upon
the two in front of him
so that they were now grouped
tightly together in the doorway
And then my heart lurched
A shadowy figure appeared
behind them a figure who
could only be Seona who
moved up to them into them
I could look straight
through into the dimming light
in the corridor I stopped with
the wire got to the tumbler
and lifted But the wire bent
I cursed pulled it clear
straightened it tried again but
again it bent
We came to the hallway
Still the silence an eerie
silence I didnt know what
to make of it Stay here I
said to the girl and then on my
toes I went over to the main 
door looked out into the courtyard
I staggered  with the effort
then gathered myself ready to deal
with the boy He had slipped back
My dear Frank When you hear this
I shall be dead
I Still had the matches On
the table stood a small oil lamp
I held my breath went over to
it raised the glass lighted it
and the room filled with a warm
mellow light
How did you get out I
didnt answer I was close very
close to death How did
you get out Still I was silent
Her voice had risen still higher

With this in mind I started my
trials with praying mantis in
kent last spring The 1960 summer
was not suitable for the start of
a trial with mantis but I did not
know that when I tied the eggcases
to my peach trees in early May
I feel certain that if one of my mantis
survived others also survived along the mass of
grapevines blackberries and other fruits
and vegetables on my 18 acre But if
the one mantis I found in the
autumn were the only survivor the
survival ratio was high at around
1 100
A British zoologist and
entomologist suggested that I try
Spanish mantis the season The first
batch of around 50 mantis hatched
from this eggcase on June 20
Meanwhile Mr Moncrieff had sent me

Ladybirds figure in press advertisements

Advertisements offer eggs of
European Chinese or native forms
of mantis From the day it
hatches in the spring until
it dies in the late autumn
the praying mantis satisfies
its voracity by eating other
insects
In their proper setting they are not
unattractive and in spite of their short
comings most gardeners have a nostalgic
affection for them Presentday pots
are better finished do not get dirty
so readily and are easier to wash
After extricating itself from
the membrane the young
mantis has to dry itself
It is at this stage that the
helpless insect is in great danger
 especially from ants I found
that neither sticky bands nor
tanglefoot deterred Kentish ants
A choice of pots By John
T Warren NDH Despite the
steady influx of substitutes
since the end of the war
clay pots are still in
greatest demand The storage
problem puts clay pots at
a definite disadvantage
Perhaps the mantis has to
be at the adult stage
before it will tackle
these insects I need
not remind readers
of the cool very wet
weather of late July August
and September 1960
One big advantage of soil blocks
is an obvious one the cost of a pot
of any description is saved completely
Many amateur gardeners might improve
their results by buying a small hand
operated soil block maker and use the
money saved on buying small pots to
improve their composts

By Bernard Hollowood in an
interview with Barry Normanton I had
been working at the Council of
industrial design in Petty France for
about three months when it

All stages of Calanus for example seem
to migrate on some occasions while any stage
may not on others Such data cannot yet
be rationalized Where information is less extensive
however it is possible to find some regularity in the
observations
Yet it must in fact be of
the utmost importance in many
cases Pressure has been suggested
as having some influence upon
migration espaecially of Calanus
But experiments expressly designed
to test this have not revealed
any change in the behaviour of
this species under pressures up
to the equivalent of 20 meters
depth
This must surely affect the responses of
animals This resulted in units of much
lighter weight than could be obtained with
tubular constructions During the 1930s the
secondary surface plateandcorrugation
construction became established for aeroengine
radiators using dipsoldered copper
Evidence has been presented for a
supposed randomness in the movement
of plankton animals If valid this implies
talk that migrations involve kinese
rather than taxes chapter 10
Such observations as have been made in
the sea indicate that the predominant
movement of copepods is directional
As well as strong naturallycharacteristic
individual variations this includes a midnight
sinking and a dawn rise At high light
intensities the animals keep station at
their optimum by a vertical hopandsink
behavior and this confirms earlier observations
on stationkeeping in Balanus nauplii
Their tentative conclusion is that
upward migration is generally a positive
movement toward a source of low
light intensities Little upward
movement can be obtained by
blacking out during the day
except with Daphnia
Furthermore the direction of
phototactic movement is
dependent upon the
postural angle of the antenna
and not the orientation of
the body This technique has
allowed for the first time
sufficient change in intensity over
limited distances for dependent
behavioral changes to be seen in
the laboratory
Yet in spite of a great amount of work the
detailed causal relationship remains one of confused
complexity Loeb First suggested the importance of
light as the governing factor but combined its influence
with that of gravity
Vertical movement occurs in some
forms apparently in the reverse manner
to that commonly met Considering
the widespread incidence of migration
in the groups concerned these may
be considered as anomalous
There is as yet no
morphological evidence
for a pressuresensitive
organ in any of these forms
and the mechanism of
perception is quite uncertain
The unequivocal demonstration
of a sensitivity to pressure
in some of the deepmigrating
copepods or decapods would
be a valuable contribution
to the whole problem
of vertical migration

It is necessary to work largely
across the grain holding the plane
askew as otherwise it will not
clear the toe Fig 4 shows
the smoothing plane in use on
the leg
In the more elaborate
varieties however a toe is worked
in the solid and this certainly
complicates the operation It is
not difficult but calls for accurate
workmanship Perhaps the
awkward feature is that the plane
can only be used to a limited
extent
Note that squared lines
marking the top member
of the toe are needed as
well as the upper extent
of the taper  and in this
case it is necessary to
The straightedge can be
used to test the straightness
of the sides Incidentally it is
better to complete any mortising
that may be needed at the top
before the tapering is begun
Incidentally  it is better
to complete any mortising
that may be needed at
the top before the
tapering is begun 
Some plan tapered
legs have the taper
on the two inner faces
only 
A great deal of modern
furniture has tapered legs  and
in reproduction period pieces
they are frequently used  The
simpler varieties are extremely
easy to work  the four sides
being simply planed to give
the required taper  In
Tool cabinet Many
men with only limi
ted accommodation
have to do their wood
work on the kitchen
table The combined bench
top and tool cupboard
shown here has been special
ly designed and made for
woodworker readers who
have this difficulty
The whole nature of a
machine is that properly set
up and used it will do accurate
work A point that may occur
to the reader is that the possible
later purchase of a machine may
render some of his hand tools
redundant
In any case glasspaper wrapped around a
shaped rubber is used to smooth the hollow finally
To complete the toe the smoothing plane can be used
to form the taper Finish the two opposite sides first
and follow with the two remaining faces
The wood is pushed for
ward until it reaches the
back stop Note the use
of the pusher stick as in
Fig 7 Each side is dealt
with in the same way Apart
from spoiling the leg it may
easily cause an accident
and may stall the machine
With this the vast majority
of jobs can be done though for
advanced Cabinet work the necessity
for certain special tools will become
obvious First however a word of advice
generally
Most men would unhesitatingly use 
a machine if it were available Choice 
of tools Coming now to the actual 
tools and their cost we begin 
with what we have called a 
bare minimum kit 
With a keen wide
chisel the wood is
now eased away
above the toe as at B A
mallet used to the chisel is a
great help providing care is taken
not to cut in too deeply
Many men with only limited accommodation have to do
their woodwork on the kitchen table Providing this is
sound some perfectly good work can be done on it but
the usual problems are those of the vice the bench stop
and storage 
Well there are many reasons
Most households have a few
basic tools  probably a
hammer pincers screwdriver etc
but one does not get far
with these As an elementary
example surely no one can
pretend to enjoy ripping
out parts from hardwood
She was so beautifully dressed
And she looked just right for the
job  to open the bazaar But oh dear
She unfolded a sheet of paper and
proceeded to read her speech  every
word of it
Good conversation can be
wonderful fun And a grand
shortener of journeys Useful
too One VIP has said that
he learns more from
conversation than from
all the books he has
read
But Thats a terrible way to
begin Why tell them you are a novice
 Its their interest you want  not
their sympathy  And you want to get it
from the world GO Try something
like this It is said that television
keeps people at home  But you 
at any
It may take you two
minutes it may take you twenty
minutes a long time that  But
before you start have it clear
in your mind what that
message is
And then in giving
your speech you in effect
give  your hearers
a series of pictures
What looked ominously like
a pair of legs was showing
under the seat in a second
class compartment
Why tell them you are a
novice It s their interest
you want  not their sympathy
And you want to get it from the
word go Try something
like this
So  see the next page 
Yes  they are waiting for you 
But there is no need to be
frightened  The audience will
eat out of your hand 
if they like what you offer
them  A good start will
put them in a good humour 
Ladies and gentlemen Im
afraid
Be natural In other words
be yourself Famous orators have
their own style You have
yours and by sticking to it
you will make a better speech
than by imitating some one
else
So by all means plan your
speech and rehease it 
see next page Take your
notes with you  if you must
You are a speaker Embarrassed
and tonguetied
His words pour out
with the flow and force of
Niagara He has the crowd
spellbound Those two
speakers are poles apart
One is yours Perhaps
you rely on a few notes
on a small bit of paper
He has the knack of
putting things in an
interesting way But more than
that he stimulates you to
contribute to the conversation too
And he can set a whole group
talking
People generally are responsive
to voices One voice will give you
pleasure and another will give you
a headache Listen to Mollie
That girl could charm the bird
from the bush
You think the man opposite would like
to chat And so would you All right
Seize your opportunity when he looks
up from his book What will you say
The usual opening and you cant better
it is to remark on the weather
Is there a moral
there for you But a
voice once heard is never
forgotten A cynic has said
that a good conversationalist
is one who talks to you
about yourself Incidentally
it s easy to forget a face
Well there you are You may 
when the producer has been
humbled  get by by answering
questions For instance you
notice an old writingdesk
So you say to your neighbour
Suppose for instance you finally have
four names on your list Then you have
four sections to your speech But
dont memorize it word for word
Each time you rehearse you will
probably put things in a different way
One of the gossips talks with
sledgehammer blows She is so sure
about things But he and the other
feels her way more gently But
conversation wilts under it Try instead
a more inquiring style 
And dont be a knowcell
There are plenty of people 
both sexes  who delight in
showing their knowledge Maybe
it s nice to know more
than some one else but it s
a mistake to show it  if
you want good conversation
A stronger finish
 and a stronger
candidate Note It s
a good plan to
memorize your beginning
and ending and ending
One speaker predicts that
unemployment will increase
He calls the Director captain
refers to him starting as cabin
boy keeping the ship off the rocks
etc A sound idea Simple words
and homely phrases give the clearest
pictures
May I suggest that you have
proved that right Congra
tulations And away you go
into your speech Take some
thought too for your ending
Thank you for listening to
me so patiently

It belonged to a Madame N
Her fiance reported her to the

We travelled down to Nice on the
Lambretta You can free
wheel down a quarter of the way
In the middle of the journey
is a valley with a sea of vines
and olives and beaches of earth
pricked to blood by the hoe
A huge crowd had collected There
were firemen and policemen and
ambulances and the eyes of the
spectators were hard with disaster
I joined her Far out at sea we
could see a circular rubber object
with a body on it
One side of this square is a
smart but modest bar
called Pierres bar
It is a pity said Mart
because it would have been a
good address
I think it s all absolutely
beastly and I cant bear to
think about it And Philip said
But we ve got to think about
it dont you see because if we
dont it ll just go on and on
dont you see
During this period he wrote
a Book the lover of Lady
Chatterly No thanks No he hadnt
read it Madame did all the
reading Lawrence died in this
very place He used to come to

weather we always stopped

grubby grandeur to the old

This was from a figure artist friend of

I should like to add that helpful
criticism all the way along plus the
environment of an enthusiastic society is
much more of a pleasure

design of the two distant
figures repeating the fore
ground figures is pleasing

these two Central figures are

is the superfluous amount of
foreground all the more noticeable
because of the outoffocus
numbering not good in this respect

trick has secured a most appealing and

This happy but impermanent State
of affairs was brought about by a
very careful application of the

revolutionary

themselfs seventeen years before had
had the slightest effect Nor is
this to be wondered at for even today

In september Sir James
Murray was replaced as

A Method of selection
25 We refer below to the
other possibilities we have
discussed 1 Selection
by the court They would
thus be in a bad frame of
mind to start the
training which now begins
on admission to prison
The Secretary of State however
would have to rely on reports from
the prison and welfare staffs and
sooner or later this would be known
to the prisoners All the undesirable
consequences of selection would
still remain
21 It must in our view be fixed
solely with the effectiveness of
aftercare in view Compulsory or
voluntary aftercare 22 There is of
course an element of contradiction in
the idea of compulsory aftercare
We shall discuss the
place of these societies in a
moderne scheme of aftercare in
our second report Existing pattern
of selection of aftercare
20 The aim of aftercare is
no doubt to protect society by helping
the offender to reestablish himself
so that he does not fall into
crime again
In practice most of those
they help are persons who are
not under the care of the after
care Council There are eight
such societies in Scotland all
but one of which carry out their
aftercare functions through parttime
agents
23 Nevertheless we do not consider that
the work of the after care Council
should be confined to assisting those
who are statutorily placed under its
supervision Ideally all discharged
prisoners and inmates might be required to
accept the councils supervision and help
If conduct in prison were a deciding
consideration selection would tend to be
left to a time near the date of release
If a prisoner is going to get aftercare
he should know it as soon as he starts
his sentence
The bcounting of the

The mixed carbonates
are dissolved in 2 N
hydrochloric acid and fed to
a column of anion exchange
resin The algae if any was
present in the effluent is
simply filtered out on top
of the resin bed
The decontamination
factor falls below 104
only for ruthenium
106 and zirconium95
with their daugthers
in the first stage ie
the lead chromate
source containing the
bismuth210 daughter
Only the weights of the
recovered lead chromate
precipitates need be known
because the concentration of the
lead carrier solution cancels out
of the algebraic equations  An
effort was made to detect the
presence of any radioactive
impurities in
During the first few hours the 
urve will be distorted if activity
other than bismuth210 is present
These bismuth nuclides may include
LIST together with their lead
parents All but lead212 will
decay completely within six hours
Therefore after a further
forty days the bismuth
daughter will be within 01
1f its final value
Knowing the time of
separation and the activity
of the lead solution
The glass tube is 11 cm long and 1 cm in
internal diameter One end of the tube is drawn
down to a fine tip and a B14 conical glass
socket is fitted to the other end as shown in
figure 1
Two samples of precipitated lead
chromate lead210 bismuth210
were counted and dissolved in nitric
acid in silica basins The bismuth was
recovered from the eluate as the phosphate
Results did not differ from those obtained
by the more convenient method of heating
the disslved chromates in 2 N hydrochloric
acid for fifteen minutes
A typical elution curve is
shown in figure 3 Once these
volumes have been established the
weight of resin used is also
fixed Polonium210 remains on the
column and does not interfere
In the preliminary experiments
the tracer was added to a liter
of effluent and immediately
coprecipitated with strontium
sulphate from hot solution Complete
exchange was obtained by
acidifying the effluent with five
milliliters of concentrated nitric
acid and boiling for more than
half an hour before
completing the coprecipitation
Excessive quantities of chloride
also reduce the gravimetric recovery of
lead Absorption of the beta particles
is also kept to a minimum but the
accuracy and precision of weighting
the precipitated sources suffers
The bismuth fraction is diluted
and phosphoric acid is added
If there is sufficient beta activity
the radiochemical purity of the Bi210
may be checked by observing the
decay curve The removal of lead
chromate from the aluminium
counting tray together with the
bismuth210 prior to the second
ion exchange separation has been
checked by counting the trays
Evaporation of sodium from
the pool C is minimised by
a close fitting cylindrical
block of electrolyte J

nickel conductor by
nickel circlips  Fixing
and positioning of
the probe relative
to the coolant
The latter as might be expected
vary considerably The above figures
show that a 14 10 deg C
temperature fluctuation at oxygen levels
in the range 110 ppm would indicate
an apparent change of 1712  1n oxygen
concentration
Thus FORM B The effect
of small changes of oxygen
concentration ant temperature
on the cell EMF The EMF
 of such a cell placed in a sodium
circuit will be affected by
fluctuations in oxygen content and
temperature
The first requirement is for
an anionic electrolyte  which can
be fabricated into suitable shapes
impervious to gases and liquid
sodium and which is neither
corroded by sodium nor by sodium
Whether such an apparatus
can be incorporated in a reactor
circuit in a manner that will
satisfy requirements will need
further study Such containment
however will be complicated by
the necessity of providing suitable
insulating seals through its
walls
Contamination of the sodium
circuit by oxygen from the cell
Experiments with solid oxide electrolyte
galvanic cells have indicated that it is
difficult to obtain  reproducible
voltages using normal potentiometric
methods at temperatures below
750 deg C
1 Standard niobium carrier solution FORM
Fuse 20 g of pure niobium pentoxide with
72 g of potassium carbonate in a platinum
dish Cool and dissolve the solidified
melt in about 400 ml of hot water
The probe can be evacuated and
filled with inert gas via the tube L
 which must of course be
electrically isolated after this has
been carried out 4 Discussion This
resulted in the oxidation of the
ve electrode and reduction of the
ve electrode which of course led to
a loss in EMF from the cell
Practical The practical application
of the above idea will involve considerable
experimentation before it can be realised
Possible materials are zirconia stabilised with
lime and thoria doped with rare earth oxides
If such a material can be made with these
properties a possible way in which the
cell may be incorporated in a sodium circuit
is depicted in Fig 4
Provided the temperatures at C and E
are the same  thermoelectric contributions
to the voltage should be zero  The probe
extends out of the sodium stream through
a close fitting thin walled TJunction

It led to no end of a muddle
with the figures Then there was
that long wrangle with the
Inland revenue over travelling
expenses The journey from Bank
to Norbiton took a large
slice out of Cecils surplus
spending power
Hello Cecil Had a busy
day His mother came into
the hall as he opened the
front door You re later
than usual arent you
There was a tinkle and a thud
from beside the coat cupboard
Cecils Mother turned around in
time to see the briefcase
collapse against the brass
umbrella stand Well now
Cecils Sole companion the parcelladen
housewife staggered to the door and prepared
to alight Madam He called after her
You ve left your briefcase His public
duty performed he pointed at the
seat opposite without making any
effort to hand it to her
He smiled at his own
joke It might be a shady
cash deal thought
specially designed to
avoid passing through the
books Perhaps the case
belonged to one of those
fellows who were
organising those girls who
operated from cars
She pointed to the briefcase So that s
why you are so irritable You thought
that I d think you d been extravagant
But I m not irritable
Lamb chops indeed Any letters
come She grimaced Only the electric bill
It s up again We ll have to go easy on the
immersion heater next quarter
Dont you feel well his
mother asked solicitously You
do look tired Go and get
yourself a drink  Dont fuss
mother Cecil stepped
towards the dining room
Her smile faded at
the thought of female
competition but
brightened again in the
belief that her son was
not cut out for that sort
of nonsense Dinner was
taken as usual before
the television
He felt in his jacket pocket and pulled
out a key  ring In succession
he tried his own briefcase key a
suitcase key and a device designed to lock
typewriters Cecil searched in his
pockets once more
Very well then His mother nodded
with understanding You re not tired
Nobody s tired Now just you run
along upstairs and wash your hands
whilst I get dinner ready
Before he could open his mouth
the collector street
stretched out a hand Watch your
step there sir Your briefcase is
hanging open You ll have someone
shoving their hot little hands inside
Surely the Govr and Compa of
the Bank of England would never
break their promise to pay on rude
demand let alone on polite request
He ruffled the sheets irritably and
glowered at his own breach of social morality
The train drew into
another station and Cecil
with a further six stops to go
was left almost alone in the
coach If the jacket is a
condition of your employment
the Inspector had written it may
qualify for relief

behind the Marshals horse
You want your pony mister
Maybe you dont know about
Appleton Dan That he s dead
I said I watched him because I
w s always fascinated by the
way he looked when you tried
to surprise him
Maybe I said But we ve
got to remember that girl all
the time Dan Of course
he said giving me one of
his strange looks
But most of us aint eddicated
in shooting It d be a massacree
yessir  We ll watch the stage out
of reach  That goes for me
gentlemen I said
I paused and watched
my words affect them in
their different ways The
rest of the men there said
nothing but you could
see they were hard hit
I guess we d better hold
onto the gold right hyar
Nick said the Sodbuster
There were mediumsized rocks and
mesquite bushes on both sides at the top
with enough cover for men and horses
until the right moment Further over
about four hundred yards West of the
trail the ground rose again to a ridge
Looks as though they re
expecting trouble I said
He was never long on patence
I saw several men running
down towards the shack
They were all armed
with rifles
This would be as good a place for
a holdup as any he said re
ining in near me Yes I said I
paused Miss Jeannie ll be on that
coach Dan
They all watched us as we ate the
beans Then when we d finished and
I d rolled a cigarette the man
called Shorty said You were
saying when you came in that
somepn happened last night
We ll leave it as we planned it last
night An Apache will give plenty silver
for a magazine rifle And somebody is
seeing that they get em We ve been alerted
Other miners followed in at our
heels Nick Dowd found us a couple of
boxes to sit on A small man in
bib overalls and a battered Derby
hat fussed around the stove
If we head West we ought to cut the
trail leading from Gilburg to the
North It got hotter as the day wore
on and we rested gratefully by a small
creek where we watered the horses
and drank enough to cure our
thirst
Or the town Marshal
I added His face was fixed
unreadable as a rock Let s
get over to the mining camp
he said abruptly
You coming back he said
when he d got the saddle fixed
I aim to I said cold as a fish
This town kind of grows on me
About four miles along it 
swung northeast  twisting and turning 
through rough country with big rocks 
sticking out all round A coach I thought 
would have to slow up some on a trail 
like that 
We didnt approach unchallenged
If you come any closer I ll
sure blow your whiskers off
Take it easy mister I sang
out We dont aim to come
any closer and we ve got no
whiskers so as you can see
Gomorrah I said absent
minded like My Pa never
made any mistake over
words from the good Book
Solong then till tomorrow Miss
Jeannie and look after
yourself
 Yes  he said  It  s a

eyes as he said this a swift 
flicker of double knowledge

Mr Lloyd said on Tuesday that he
proposed to deal in his next regular budget
with some profits which now escape tax
Sir Edward Boyle Financial Secretary to the
Treasury said yesterday that the Government does
not like retrospective legislation
There were no other attacks
of such ferocity As Mr
Macmillan made his
announcement the
House was crowded
Near the end of a long
statement Mr Macmillan
stated the governments

If we joined the Common Market 
our food subsidies would probably
be replaced by a system of tariffs 
That will mean a rise in the cost

the decision shocking and added
It is the most disastrous thing

concluded The best service the
Prime Minister can do would be

MPs of
Mr Fell appeared to be in tears
as he sat down He returned five
minutes later to stand just
inside the doorway looking more
composed This seemed to
infuriate Mr Fell even more
Why dont you make proposals
to legislate in the autumn
Mr Wilson asked We wouldnt
call it an autumn budget
You can call it a taxation
management bill if you like
As Mr  Macmillan made his announcement  the
House was crowded  He said No  British
Government could join the European Economic
Community without prior negotiation
with a view to meeting the needs of

parting speech had sung
itself over and over
in her mind Did that
mean  no it couldnt
mean that Oliver was in
love with her
She laughed mischievously and
without envy As you may have
gathered Norrie Jo s fallen for
the man hook line and sinker
And I d say he d be equally
enthusiastic if it wasnt for his
wifes restraining influence
She knew that they had always been
ambitious eager to try their wings in
a wider sphere but now the chance had
come they seemed to be thinking of
nothing and no one save themselves
And Noreen did
you remember to
feed the chickens
The two girls follo
wed their mother
downstairs Noreen care
fully shutting the door
behind them and delibe
rately ignoring Joannas
murmur of protest
Wondering expecting a
protest she half turned and
looked at him Joannas Eyes
suddenly softened and a reluctant
feeling of compassion swept
over her But before she could
speak he had recovered his normal
selfcontrol
A tiny shiver went down
Joannas spine but he did not touch
her Well that s grand Just what you
hoped for isnt it As a matter of fact
I ve got some news for you too
His hands clenched
involuntarily as he looked at her 
so lovely with that glow of colour
in her cheeks her hair a bright halo
about her upthrown head Why not
Steve
By the way She turned
to Noreen I suppose you
realize that we want you to
come with us when we go
back to town We explained to
Mr Delorme that we must
have you as our accompanist 
With an impatient movement she 
pulled free from him and turned 
quickly away towards the window 
speaking with her back to him 
 Don  t go on Steve Oh don  t think 
I don  t like you and I suppose 
I should say thank you for  
for wanting to marry me 
Joanna stubbed out her
cigarette with unnecessary
fierceness Her lovely eyes
were defiant above cheeks whose
colour had deepened at Noreens
remark There are some people
you dont have to know for
years before you can trust them
Mr Redfern Very kindly brought
me home in his car Mrs Sang
ster explained as they came
into the room Lorraine greeted
him pleasantly enough but
Joannas greeting was barely
polite
Nothing to make one  s 
nerves tingle and one  s 
heart race  as it had done 
only this morning A dreamy 
smile spread over her face as 
her mind went back to those 
heavenly moments 
She had nodded unable to find words that would
tell him her feelings Well it must be au revoir
then He had put his hands on her shoulders
and smiled down into her eyes
After they had gone there was an 
awkward little silence then Stephen 
said gently  I hope everything 
went as well as you expected 
Jo Better really We shall be 
going to London at the end of 
this month 
Let s part good friends Jo dear
If you re going to get your hearts
desire that s all that really matters to
me Will you apologize to your mother
for me and tell her I m sorry I
cant stay to supper after all
Oh at the hospital I suppose
Lorraine did not wait for her mother
to confirm or deny this but turned
back to Noreen Mr Delorme was
thrilled Johanna went on breathlessly
Dont be so naive and stupid
Norrie There are night clubs
and night clubs as you d know
if you werent such an ignoramus
This is one of the top places
frightfully swell
